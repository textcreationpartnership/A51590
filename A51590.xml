            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>NOw I beſeech you Bretheren, mark thoſe which cauſe diviſions, and offenſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.</hi> Rom. 16.17. Theſe words were the words of God, and of truth, as well in the yeare 1517. as at this preſent yeare. Had any good Chriſtian ſpoaken theſe words in that foreſaid yeare 1517. all, who had heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could have made no other ſenſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they were forewarned by them both to <hi>marke,</hi> and <hi>to avoid</hi> all Authors <hi>of diviſions, and offenſes contrary to the doctrine which they had learned:</hi> yet, as then, there was not any good Chriſtian (unles you will account them for ſuch, whome you yourſelves acknowledg to have maintained groſſe Hereſies) who did not beleeve, and profeſſe the Roman Faith. This was the <hi>Faith and Doctrine</hi> which they had learned. Wherefore, when in that yeare Luther firſt appeared, cauſing
<hi>diviſions, and offenſes, contrary to the Doctrine which they had learned,</hi> all were bound, by the adviſe of the Apoſtle, to
<hi>mark,</hi> and <hi>avoid</hi> the ſayd Luther and all his adherents, and followers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the world then no leſſe addicted to old vices, then to new doctrines, did ſhutt <pb facs="tcp:59494:3"/> they reares to this adviſe of the Apoſtle and did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr armes to imbrace that, which was (in ſo very many Points) <hi>contrary to the Doctrine which they had learned.</hi> And the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is, that, all thoſe new Teachers, which enſued in whole ſwarmes, though they all taught <hi>contrary to what they had learned,</hi> yea, and the one contrary to the other, yet all pretended to teach nothing but Scripture rightly underſtood, which they all affirmed not to have been rightly underſtood, for the foregoeing thouſand yeares, in ſuch points as then they began to queſtion: yet with the ſame breath, they ſayd, that in all thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Points, in which they contradicted the former doctrine (and by doing ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great <hi>diviſions, and offenſes</hi>) they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme only that, to which they were enforced by evident, manifeſt, and moſt cleer Texts of Scripture. Which was to ſay that, for the precedent thouſand yeares, no body had rightly underſtood, or at leaſt every body had by word and practiſe contradicted, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, manifeſt, and moſt cleere Texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The good Chriſtians of thoſe ages, and we who adhere unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being in the quiet <pb facs="tcp:59494:3"/> and peaceable poſſeſſion of what we had learned, were bound (according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtle) to avoid thoſe new tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; and it was ſufficient for us to ſhew they taught <hi>contrary to what we had learned,</hi> which they themſelves confeſſed to be true and was too evident to require proofe. But becauſe we ſtood conſtantly to maintain <hi>what we had learned</hi> upon this ground, as the Apoſtle did bid us; our Adverſaries, deſirous to bring us, from beleeving, to diſputing, would be ſtill importunely preſſing us to prove, Point by Point, every Point, which we held, by evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, manifeſt, and moſt clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Scripture. We vvell underſtood that it was theyr parts (who affirmed all former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for ſome thouſand yeares at leaſt, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve thus groſly erred againſt cleere Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) to make good ſo great, and ſo ſcandalous an accuſation by producing Texts (in the Points under queſtion) of ſo manifeſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable evidence againſt us, that theyr, Texts, compared to ours alleadged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſame Points, ſhould make the Truth ſo cleer on theyr ſide, that all might be forced to confeſſe they had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt (as they did) from all theyr Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb facs="tcp:59494:4"/> and Civill Magiſtrates, and to frame allſo a new body by themſelves, wholy, and entirely, both in doctrine, and diſcipline, quite different, yea and contrary, to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as then, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the earth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The exorbitancy of this theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding will be unjuſtifyable when I ſhall here produce ſo many and ſo loud-ſpeaking texts, for above forty of thoſe Points which they moſt miſliked in our Religion; yea it was our holding thoſe Points, for which, they ſayd, they were enforced to this ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>a Diviſion.</hi> But how weakly they were enforced, upon this account, to <hi>cauſe ſuch diviſions and offenſes,</hi> will eaſily be ſeen by any impartiall eye, which ſhall attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſe on the one ſide al the texts, which I ſhall here alleadg for forty five of thoſe Points (for which chiefly they have cauſed this diviſion) and on the other, the few and inconſiderable and a thouſand-times-anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered Texts, which they bring to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This then is the Plea of us Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that we, ever ſince our Anceſtors in England were Chriſtians, have held <hi>the doctrine which we have learned, still avoiding tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe <pb facs="tcp:59494:4"/> who taught the contrary.</hi> For, that we have done this in no fewer then fifty Points (in which we are moſt accuſed of Novelty) hath been demonſtrated, in a late booke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Englands old Religion out of Bedes owne words.</hi> And though <hi>Bede</hi> had not been (as he was) the moſt grave, and famed Authour which ever England had; but had been only a <hi>lack ſtraw living and writing</hi> before the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are 731. (that is above 900. yeares agoe) yet to ſee, in <hi>his words then writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> thoſe <hi>fifty Points</hi> all held, and all practiſed in our England, when Englands Religion was at the pureſt, cannot but abundantly convince that we Roman Catholiks did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold, and practice what we hold, and practiſe now. What is this, but to <hi>hold the doctrine we have learned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding thoſe who teach the contrary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet this is not our whole Plea; for wee know it will be objected that, what we then learnt, was contrary to Scripture; and they muſt meane cleer, and manifeſt Scripture, or elſe why did they go againſt the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and practiſe which they found agreeing ſo exactly with the doctrine and practice of <hi>old England,</hi> as is unanſwerably demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that book. But we <hi>further more plead,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:59494:5"/> that in thoſe very Points, in which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, yea and manifeſt contradiction to Scripture, is objected againſt us, we have Scripture ſpeaking ſo fully for us, that no one of thoſe many Religions now tolerated in England, can, with any colour of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, challenge greater evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for theyr oppoſit Tenets, then we here produce for our undoubtedly ancient doctrine: and therefore this our doctrine, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this reſpect, ought, in all reaſon, to be at leaſt as much tolerated as any of thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions lately ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g up in England. The proof of what I ſay, muſt rely upon what ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be made good by me in each point, of thoſe forty five, here enſuing</p>
            <p n="7">7. It only remaines that I advertiſe the reader how impoſſible it is that I, or any one elſe, ſhould cite all Texts juſt in thoſe very words in which he will find them in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Bible; for you have ſo many ſeverall tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlations of the English Bible, that, whilſt I oblige my ſelfe to follow one, I shall make ſure not to follow the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conceived the beſt expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to avoid this difficulty would be to follow alwayes either the very words, or the full ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of that English Bible which <pb facs="tcp:59494:5"/> is moſt univerſally received. And in this point I have been ſo very ſcrupulous, that I continually admonish my Reader if at any one time I chance to put downe any ſingle text differing in ſenſe from the English Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vvich I have made choice of, as the beſt edition of theyr moſt received Bible, which is that which was ſet forth <hi>at Cambridg</hi> 1635. printed by <hi>Thomas and Iohn Buck</hi> Printers to that Vniverſity, which Bible <hi>King Iames</hi> did cauſe to be ſet forth
<hi>out of his deep Iudgment apprehending how convenient it was, that out of the Originall ſacred tongues, there should be a more exact Tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as is ſayd in the Preface of this Tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dedicated to his Majeſty.</p>

                  <hi>THE FIRST POINT.</hi> That Scripture alone can not be a Rule ſufficient to direct us in all neceſſary Controverſies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O Roman Catholike doth deny the Scripture to be a ſufficient Rule to direct us in all controverſies, if wee take the Scripture rightly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore all thoſe many textes, which Proteſtantes bring, to prove the Scripture to be our ſole Rule of fayth, are very clearely anſwered by ſaying that all thoſe Textes ſpeake of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not taken as the letter ſounds (for the letter kills 2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) but they ſpeake of the Scripture as rightly interpreted. And Proteſtantes cannot but graunt the Scripture rightly interpreted to be a ſufficient Rule of fayth. But what are wee the nearer? For now comes the great Queſtion of Queſtions, who be thoſe that give the right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to Scripture?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very ground of all Religions but the Roman is the Scripture as Interpreted by theyr own ſelves, after they have carefully conferred one place with an other. For I aske, and ask them again and again, by whom Scripture ought to be interpreted? They will ſay by Scripture conferred
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59494:8"/> with Scripture. Here I muſt yet ask them again, by whom the conference of one Scripture, with another, can be made ſo exactly that from hence wee may come vndoubtedly to know the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation? This queſtion I will be ſtill asking them, untill they can anſwer it. For I am ſure that, If I preſſe this queſtion home, they muſt be at laſt enforced to ſay that the ground of their whole Religion is, the Scripture interpreted by them ſelves, when it hath bin carefully conferred by them ſelves, ſo that the very ground of their whole fayth is deceiptfull, and fallible, if they them ſelves be fallible, either in interpteting, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Scripture carefully or skillfully. If they ſay their Interpretation, thus made, is undoubted, and infallible, then they can not blame us, for ſaying that the interpretation of the Church, made with as great care, and skill (uſed by her in the exact conference of one Scripture with an other) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Stay here (Deare Reader) and, as thou loveſt thy ſaluation, before thou goeſt any fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, ponder attentively how fallible, and ſubject to a world of errors, the ground of all ſuch Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions muſt needs be, which wholy and entirely are found, at laſt, to rely upon a meer human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, after that a meer human, and moſt fallible diligence, and skill, hath bin employed in conferring one Text with an other. Then ponder
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59494:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> on the other ſide how incomparably ſurer, and more juſtifiable in the ſight of God, and man, the ground of that faith is, which relyeth indeed on the Scripture; but not on the Scripture, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by private, and fallible interpreters, after theyr moſt fallible exactneſſe of conferring Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with Scripture: but which relyeth upon Scripture, as interpreted by the Church, after that ſhee, (with no leſſe exactnes) hath conferred one Scripture with an other in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, having incomparable greater human abilities, then thoſe of any private mans be, and having the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the Holy Hoſt, leading his Church into all truth. Of this infallibility wee ſhall ſpeak fully. Point
5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now the Scripture (as rightly interpreted by the Church) will ſend us, for the clearing of many doubtes, unto the Church, authorized by Chriſt to inſtruct, and teach us, as in that fift Point ſhall be evidenced out of Scripture The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce then between our adverſaries and us, is, that wee affirme the Scripture, as it is rightly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, (after ſhe hath exactly confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a general Councel Scripture with Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) to be the Rule of Faith, by which ſhe decideth all neceſſary Controverſies. But our adverſaries (miſliking the dependence on the Church) will have the Scripture, by it ſelfe alone, to be a Rule ſufficient to direct each one, who ſhall carefully
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59494:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> conferre it, to judge all neceſſary Controverſies. This wee deny, and though they ſay it in wordes, yet in very deed they alſo come to deny what they ſay; for let a man mark it well, and he ſhall ſee, that all theſe ſectaries, when they come to the maine Controverſie, do not take Scripture alone, as conferred with Scripture only, but they all take Scripture with theyr own interpretation, made upon theyr own conference. And if you tell them they have fayled, by not taking due notice of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other Texts in Scripture, which ſhould have been pondered in their Conference, and would have produced a different interpretation, they will ſay, their own ſpirit tels them the contrary, ſo that finally, they (who laugh at the Church for truſting to be ſecurely guided by the Holy Ghoſt) come to ground theyr whole fayth upon the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being truly guided by theyr own ſpirit or judgement but let us come to what we propound and let us prove by Scripture that Scripture, taken as they take it, can not be a ſufficient Rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in all neceſſary Controverſies. This I prove.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe to end all Controverſies wee muſt at leaſt rule our ſelves by al the bookes of Scripture, and we muſt be aſſured wee doe ſo. This is cleere becauſe, by no text of Scripture, it can be prouved that any determed booke, or number of bookes, is ſufficient to end all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59494:9"/> But to do this, the whole number of books written by any Scripture writer is wholy requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, ſeeing that no Text ſpeaks of any one, or any determinate number; but all ſpeake of all. Now marke to what paſſe this opinion brings you. For, if wee be to judge all neceſſary Controverſies by all the bookes, which ever were written by any Scripture writer, we muſt neceſſarily have theſe books amongſt us. But wee have not in the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le world extant amongſt us diverſe books of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Propheticall Scriptures. For no fewer then twenty books of the Propheticall Pennemen of the Holy Ghoſt, have quite periſhed, as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Contzen proveth in his Preface upon the fower Ghoſpels; and I will prove this as far as is ſufficient by theſe following texts. Ioſue 10.13. <hi>Is not this written in the book of Iaſcker?</hi> Again 1. Kinges 4.32. <hi>Salomon ſpoke three thouſand Proverbs and his ſonges were one thouſand and five.</hi> Again 1. Chron.
29.29. <hi>The actes of David firſt and laſt are written in the book of Samuel the Seer and the book of Nathan the Prophet, and the book of Gad the Seer.</hi> Where be theſe two Prophets books? Again 2. Chron. 9.29. mention is made of the <hi>books of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than the Prophet and the Propheſie of Ahyah, and the viſions Iddo the Seer.</hi> And Chap 12.15. and the book
<hi>Schemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Genealogies;</hi> which ſeemes to be a different book from <hi>his book of viſions</hi> before ſpecifyed. <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59494:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> And Chap. 13.22. mention is made of the <hi>ſtory of the Prophet Iddo</hi> And Ch. 20.34. mention is made of the book of Iehu, ſonne of Hanani, and Ch 33.19 wee find mention of the works
<hi>of the ſayings of the Seers.</hi> Wee know then by Scripture that what is ſayd by thoſe books is ſayd by Prophets: <hi>And wee alſo know by Scripture that God ſpoke in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.21. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover we know by Scripture that
<hi>Propheſie came not in old time by the will of man. But the Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.21 Standing therefore to what is known by Scripture, theſe bookes, which have periſhed, did deliver what was ſpoken by the Holy Ghoſt, and contained the true word of God. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is proved that we have not (now) entierly the whole word of God written; and this is further proved by the enſuing textes of S. Paul 1. Cor.
5.9. <hi>I wrote to you in one Epiſtle.</hi> Note that he ſayth this in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>to them.</hi> Where is the Epiſtle which S. Paul wrote
<hi>to them</hi> before he wrote the firſt to them? <hi>I wrote to you.</hi> Wee then ſay: Give us all ſacred Propheticall writings, which ever were written, or give us at leaſt ſome one, ſingle, cleare text, which tells us that wee are to end all neceſſary Controverſies, by ſuch books alone as be now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the true Cannon of Scripture, or elſe be aſhamed to ſpeak with out a text, in this very queſtion, in which you affirme, that all our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59494:10"/> Controverſies muſt be ended by only cleere Scripture. The Controverſie about this very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is one of the greateſt of all Controverſies, and yet you would have us credit you, without beeing able to bring cleer Scripture for what you ſay; eſpecially Scripture conferred with theſe now cited texts, of which I dare ſay you never thought. And though you ſhould bring me a cleer text to prove what is deſired, yet where would you find a cleer text, to ſhew me that all thoſe twelve books (yea, or any one of them) which you have rejected amongſt the Apocrypha, do not belong to the true Canon of the whole Scripture. Remember I call for a text as you bid me; and not for a reaſon againſt which wee have our reaſons; the Text ſay you muſt end all neceſſary Controverſies. Let then ſome Text be brought able to end this, even in your own Iudgement.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondly</hi> if Scripture only be the Rule to end all neceſſary controverſies, then ſome Ages had no ſuch Rule at all; but were deſtitute of all aſſured Rule to end theyr neceſſary controverſies, and that for two thouſand, and four hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res together. For Moſes (who was the firſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture writer) was not borne, but after the world had ſtood two thouſand and four hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, as may be made aparent by Scripture, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating the Ages of ſuch, as ſucceſſively lived one after the other, according to his own Hiſtory of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59494:11"/> Geneſis: ſoo long therefore the world was with out any Scripture. Scripture then is not the only Rule of true Faith, ſeeing that
<hi>Sara, Rebecca</hi> and others of thoſe times had true faith, though theyr faith was only ſquared by the Rule of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theyr Church, as wee will ſee in the next Point. n. 2.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Thirdly</hi> the Rule, by which all men ſhould be ruled in all neceſſary points, ſhould be in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage underſtood by all. But it is cleere that moſt of the Iews, in the Captivity of Babilon, had loſt the knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, wherein the old Scripture was written. Neither was the Bible tranſlated into the Syriak language, till ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me yeares after our Saviours death. Syriak differs as much from Hebrew, as Italian from Latin. And the very letters differ as much as Greeke and Latin. The Iews then, for above fourteene Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations underſtood the Hebrew no more then your people now underſtand the Bible in Latin. But of all this I ſhall ſpeak more fully Point the 15. n. 1.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Fourthly.</hi> That can not be a ſufficient Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le to decide all neceſſary controverſies, which ſpeaks not one word of many neceſſary contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. But the Scripture ſpeakes not a word of many neceſſary Controverſies. <hi>Ergo, &amp; firſt</hi> it is neceſſary to know which bookes of Scripture be Canonicall, and which not. Alſo whether the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59494:11"/> bookes wee now have, be alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide us in all neceſſary controverſies?
<hi>Then</hi> whether they can do this, if they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt. <hi>And</hi> how wee ſhall aſſuredly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be incorrupted or not? Or which is the Copie that is uncorrupt. <hi>Again,</hi> which is the true Tranſlation of this Copie. <hi>Again,</hi> which is the true ſenſe of this Tranſlation; and that aſſuredly, with a cleere Text for this aſſurance? Of theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more particular controverſies, not a word in Scripture. <hi>Again,</hi> ſtanding to Scripture alone, the Hereſy of Helvidius (denying our Bleſſed Lady ever to have remained a Virgin) ſeemeth rather to have had ſome colourable defence, then any cleere jugdment give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt it by Scripture only. For Matth. 1.25. <hi>He knew her not till the brought forth her firſt borne Sonne.</hi> In which Text theſe words, <hi>till she brought forth</hi> and thoſe others; <hi>her firſt borne Sonne,</hi> give ſome colour to ſay ſhe had other Sonnes afterwardes. For which doctrine <hi>Helvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was held an Heretik by S. Auguſtin. Her. 84. and by S. Hierome <hi>contra Helvidium.</hi> You may ſee fower and twenty neceſſary Pointes ſett downe all at large by
<hi>Optatus</hi> Ductor in <hi>his Queſtion of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,</hi> no one of which are cleerly decided in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Fiftly</hi> that can not he a ſufficient Rule to decide all neceſſary Controverſies, which in ſuch controverſies, ſpeakes not cleerly but is very hard <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59494:12"/> to be underſtood as the Scripture is. Whence we ſee all Controverſies ariſe about the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch, and ſuch Texts. So 2. Pet. 3.16. <hi>In the which</hi> (Epiſtles of S. Paul) <hi>are certeine thinges hard to be underſtood, which the unlearned and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wreſt, as they do the other Scriptures unto theyr owne damnation.</hi> Whence it is evident that <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errors</hi> may be incurred by miſinterpteting <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hard to be underſtood.</hi> And ſo this <hi>hardnes</hi> is found in <hi>pointes neceſſary to ſaluation.</hi> For in ſuch <hi>only damnable</hi> errors can be incurred.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Sixtly</hi> Chriſt did not command any one of the Evangeliſtes to write his Ghoſpell. They all did write of themſelves upon particular oca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, expreſſed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> S. Luke tells you, in his Preface, why he did write uncommanded, Chriſt then intended to leave us ſome other Rule then this, which he never commanded to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at all, much leſſe to be written ſo, as to be to us the only Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Seaventhly</hi> by reading the Ceremoniall law, given by God to Moyſes ſoo cleerely, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and ſo cloſſe together, in the compaſſe of no great book, I evidently inferre, that if the ſelfe ſame moſt prudent Lawmaker, had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in the bookes of Canonicall Scripture, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverd unto us the ſole Rule of Faith, and which alone we were to follow; he would not only have cleerly told us ſo, but he would, with no leſſe, but <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59494:12"/> rather with more clarity, and diſtinction, and in a farr leſſe compaſſe, have ſett downe unto us this Rule, intierly and compleatly together in ſome one part of the Canonicall Scripture, diſtinctly expreſſing all thoſe pointes, the beliefe of which he exacteth of us, under paine of damnatiun For this did much more import to be done thus, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſtinctly then the ſetting downe of the Iewiſh Ceremoneyes. For is it likely, that the ſame God who preſcribed unneceſſary Ceremonies to be ſo cleerly, and diſtinctly ſet down, in a few lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, to direct the Iewiſh Church (which is but the Hand Mayd) would not, for the Church of Chriſt (which is the Miſtris) give as clear a direction, in Pointes wholy neceſſary to ſaluation? But would ſend every one of her Children to read over the whole Bible, and to pick out here one place, and there an other, as Proteſtantes ſay God ſends us to ſeeke, even the moſt neceſſary Pointes of our beliefe, (which he requires of us under paine of damnation) now in this place of ſo vaſt a Vollume as the Bible is, now in an other place hard by, now in another a greate way of. And ſo to goe ſeeking, from the beginning of Geneſis, to the end of the Apocalipſe. And this though the number, of Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes neceſſary to ſaluation, be but ſmale, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants all agree. I can not therefore thinke is was Gods intention te leave us to the Bible only, as to the ſole Rule of Faith.</p>

                  <hi>THE SECOND POINT.</hi> Tradition beſides Scripture muſt direct us, in many neceſſary Controverſies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrſt, the word of God may be notified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Tradition, with out writing; or by Scripture, or writing. It is undoubted, that the word of God written, or unwritten, is the Rule of Faith; wherefore, ſeeing it hath been proved (in the former Point) that the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of God is not our only Rule of Faith, it evidently followeth that Gods unwritten word (notified by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) muſt be taken as part of this Rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> Moyſes was the firſt Scripture writer, and he, according to his own ſtory, did not write till the world had continued above two thouſand, and four hundred yeares: ſo long then all the faithfull in the world, were truly faithfull without any Scripture. All this long time then, the unwritten word of God (that is Tradition) was the only Rule of Faith. For even then many had that faith which is defined by S. Paul 11. Hebr. 1. which I prove, becauſe in that very place he numbers <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noë, Abraham, and Sara,</hi> all having the faith he there deſcribed: and yet <hi>Sara</hi> cannot be ſhewed to have had her faith grounded <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59494:13"/> on any other word of God, but that which was delivered by the Tradition of the Church in her times. And generally then, the faith of all true beleivers, was grounded upon Tradition only. By this Tradition they knew that God <hi>bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day and ſanctified it.</hi> Gen. 2.3. And ſo all held themſelves obliged to keep the Saboth. By this Tradition they knew the diſtinction of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
<hi>cleane and uncleane.</hi> Gen. 7.2. By this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they knew themſelves obliged <hi>not to eate the flesh with the blood,</hi> Gen. 9.4. ſo likewiſe that the Tithes were to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yd to the Prieſt, Gen. 14.20. By only Tradition they knew the fall <hi>of Adam,</hi> theyr future ſaluation by the Meſſias to come; theyr remedy from ſinne by Pennance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, theyr reward of Good, puniſhment of evell.

17.10. Now give me one Text if you can which bide us not to take Tradition for a Rule of Faith, after the writing of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> even after the writing of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; the Gentils had not the Scripture, yet by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only, many of them (as apeares by the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Iob) retained true faith. And even among the Iews, after they had the Scripture, ſeveral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59494:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> Pointes where left to be knowne by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only: as the remedy for Original ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eight day, and for woemen children both before and after. As alſo by only Tradition they knew, that all the vertue there ſacrifices had to take away ſinne, was from the blood of theyr Redeemer to come. The obſerving of al theſe traditions, was not any unlawfull Addition to the written word of God; whence you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the clere meaning of thoſe words ſo often objected againſt us Deut. 4.2.
<hi>You shall not adde to the word I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it.</hi> For here is only forbidden to add contrary to the law. So that other place Ch 12.32. <hi>Whatſoever I command you obſerve, thou shall not adde thereunto nor diminish from it.</hi> For this place is meant only of offerings, not any other ſacrifices, beſides thoſe, which were in the law preſcribed. But it was ever lawfull, for lawfull Superiors, to add more preceps agreable to the law. So 2. Ch. 30.21. after the Children of Iſraël, according to the law, had kept the ſolemnity of Azymes ſeven dayes v. 23. <hi>The whole aſſembly took good counſel to keep other ſeven dayes.</hi> And v. 27. <hi>Theyr prayer came to the Holy habitation of heaven.</hi> This addition then did not diſpleaſe God. Again Eſther 9.27.
<hi>The Iews ordained and tooke upon them and theyr ſeede and upon all that would be ioyned with them, ſo as it should not faile, that they keep theſe two <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59494:14"/> dayes, and that theſe dayes should be kept through out every Generation, every family:</hi> Behold here an other addition: and behold alſo an other again of the <hi>Dedication of the Altar made for eight dayes from yeare to yeare.</hi> 1. Mach. 4.56.59. And that you may know that this booke is Scripture; or at leaſt, that a feaſt is to be kept not appointed in Scripture, our Saviour himſelfe did keep this Feaſt Iohn.
10.22. as I ſhall shew Point 38. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the change of the Sabboth into the Sunday is only clearly known by Tradition. Yea the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of keeping it, is contrary to all Scripture we have; for Scripture ſayth Levit. 23.32. <hi>From Even unto Even shall ye celebrate Your Sabboth.</hi> Yet we do not begin the Sunday the even before, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare wee worke after the even upon Sunday. Who taught us this? Tradition only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly</hi> Tradition is (and therfore is truly to be held) the word of God making us fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of what is not written. For example for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me yeares after the Death of our Saviour; his glorification after death was not written ſo as to expreſſe, that Ieſus was that Chriſt, whom God had glotified; and yet before this was written S. Peter ſayd truly Acts 2.36. <hi>Therefore let all the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly</hi> (marke the word aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>that God hath made the ſame Ieſus, whome you have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> We may then have an infallible faith of what is not written, yea we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59494:15"/> are forbidden to believe otherwiſe then was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Tradition 2. Theſſ. 2.14. <hi>Therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren ſtand and hold the Traditions you have bin taught, whether by word or by our Epiſtle.</hi> For what he taught by his tongue only was as truly the word of God, as what he did alſo write with his penne. Yea this which I call Tradition is the
<hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Chriſt</hi> 2. Cor. 33. <hi>you are the Epiſtle of Chriſt not written with inke, but with the ſpiritt of the living God. This Epiſtle written with the ſpiritt of the living God</hi> is no leſſe true, nor of leſſe credit then what is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with inke in papers. Whereforemoſt of the Apoſtles did give their Convertites no other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of beliefe, but what (by their preaching) they had written in theyr heartes,
<hi>not with inke but with the ſpiritt of the living God.</hi> For the proper ſubject to receive, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ayne the word of God, is not paper, but the heartes of the faythfull. Whence S. Irenaeus lib. 3. cap. 4. <hi>What if the Apoſtles had alſo left no Scripture! Ought not we to follow the order of Tradition which they delivered to them, to whom they committed the Churches? To which ordinance many Nations of thoſe barbarous people, who have believed in Chriſt, do conſent with out letter or inke, having ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (that is ſoul-ſaving doctrine) written in their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artes.</hi> For a world of the firſt believers did never ſo much as ſee all ſcripture. It was the yeare 99. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Iohn writt his Goſpell. And when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture was fully ended, there is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59494:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> made, euen of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

All this cleerly proves that Tradition was relyed upon, as upon the word of God it ſelfe. Whence S. Paul did not only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but alſo comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, the Theſſalonians to with draw them ſelves from all who walked not, after the Tradition they had received of their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Hold faſt the good forme of good words which thou haſt heard of me, That good thing, which was committed to thee, keep by the H.

So alſo, when as yet by writing he had taught the Romans nothing, he, in his firſt, and only Epiſtle to them, wrote thus Rom. 16.17. <hi>Now I beſeeeh you Bretheren mark them which cauſe diviſions, and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned.</hi> Likwiſe, when as yet he had written nothing, to the Galatians (for where is any ſuch writing?) he begines thus Gal. 1.6. <hi>I maruel that ſo ſoon you are removed from him, who called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto an other Ghoſpell.</hi> I ſay <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> that is changed, <hi>from the forme of Faith,</hi> which I delivered, which was a true, though not a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Ghoſpel, <hi>into an other Ghoſpel</hi> taught by theſe new <hi>otherwiſe teathers,</hi> yet ſayth he, with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>Although wee or an Angel from heaven preach any other Ghoſpel unto you then that ye have receaved let them be accurſed.</hi> v. 8. S.

For what, as then had they received from him in writing? And he ſayth no more then other Apoſtles. (Who did wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te nothing, but delivered all by Orall Tradition) might truly have ſayed of the Ghoſpel ſo delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them. Neither did S. Paul ſpeake of what they ſhould receive many yeares after but of what they had <hi>as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> received.</hi> For that was as true as any thing they ſhould receive by writing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for theyr forſaking of what they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus, he moſt deſervedly ſayth unto them: <hi>O Foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you?</hi> c. 3. v. 1. For indeed they ſeeme bewitched out of theyr ſenſes, who, to follow the private judgment of ſome <hi>otherwiſe teachers,</hi> reject what they had

                  <hi>THE THIRD POINT.</hi> Of the never fayling of the Church which beeing perpetuall can preſerve perpetuall Traditions Alſo of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of true Paſtors and Profeſſors.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF the Church of Chriſt could fayle, or cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to be, it is evident Tradition might fayle, and not be preſerved in its purity. The true Church is both infallible, as long as ſhe laſts (of which ſee Point 5) and is allſo ſure to laſt to the end of the world. Yea ſhe is aſſured all this time to have a lawful ſucceſſion of true Paſtors, and under them true Profeſſors of the faith in a vaſt number; find any ſuch Church beſides the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if you can, and I give you leave to call that the true Church. And leſt perhaps the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of powerfull Texts, which we are to cite, ſhould worke ſmale effect with minds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with one or two objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we will firſt cleare them, and then paſſe to the manifold cleere Texts which demonſtrate <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59494:18"/> the true Church at no time to be in a lurking In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The prime objection is from the wordes of Elias 1. Kinges 18.22. <hi>I, even I, only remaine a Prophet of our Lord.</hi> And in the next Chap. v. 10. I, <hi>even I, only am left</hi> which again he repeates v. 14. I anſwer, that, at leſt, he is told preſently by God v. 18.
<hi>That there were left in Iſraël ſeven thouſand men, whoſe knees had not bin bowed before Baal.</hi> And in the former Chapter, it is manifeſt he knew of an hundred Prophets. For v. 13. Abdias told him, <hi>I hidd of the Prophets of our Lord an hundred men by fifty and fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, in caves.</hi> Wherefore he knew well that there were many faithfull, amongſt whom ſo many Prophets were known to him; yea hence it is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that he was not the only Prophet left. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe words <hi>I only I remaine a Prophet of our Lord</hi> are to be underſtood thus. I, only I, remaine a Prophet, ſtanding openly to oppoſe theyr fury amongſt the Apoſtated Tribes of Iſraël. For Elias knew full well that, not all the Children of Iſraël, but only tenne Tribes were faln from God. 1. Kinges 12. He knew allſo that the ſtill faithfull Tribe of Iuda (including Benjamin) afforded Roboam <hi>an hundred and four ſeore thouſand choſen men,</hi> to fight againſt the other revolted tenne Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes v. 21. which is again repeated 2. Chron. 11. with a notable declaration how much the true Church, even then, floriſhed in Iuda and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59494:18"/> Roboam himſelfe building <hi>fifteene cities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with walls:</hi> And (v. 13. <hi>the Preeſtes and Levits that were in all Iſraël reſorted to him out of all theyr coaſts.</hi> And v. 16. <hi>Of all the Tribes of Iſraël, whoſoever had given theyr heartes to ſeeke theyr Lord God of Iſraêl, came into Ieruſalem to ſacrifice and they ſtrengthned the Kingdome of Iuda.</hi> All this Elias knew very well and alſo that which follows, to witt that Aſa reigned over all Iuda in all pietie and peace 2. Chron. 14. And <hi>he built other fenced cities in Iuda.</hi> And v. 8. <hi>Aſa had of Iuda an army of three hundred thouſand and of Benjamin two hundred eighty thouſand. And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated tenn hundred thouſand Ethiopians.</hi> And 2. Chr. 17. Ioſaphat (who lived in the day's of Elias) was yet greater then Aſa his Father, both in piety and power. For v. 10. <hi>The Dread of our Lord came about all the Kingdomes of the Lands that were about Iuda Neither durſt they make battell againſt Ioſaphat.</hi> And he built many ſtrong cities, and ſtupendious was the number of his forces v. 14. of Iudath under Abnath <hi>Three hundred thouſand;</hi> and <hi>two hundred eighty thouſand</hi> under Iohanan.
<hi>And two hundred thouſand under Amaſias.</hi> And <hi>two hundred thouſand under Ehada</hi> And <hi>two hundred eighty thouſand under Ioſobad</hi> All theſe make <hi>Eleven hundred thouſand and ſixty thouſand ſoldiers. And yet the Scripture ſayth: All theſe were at the hand of the King, beſides others who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he had putt in Walled cities in Iuda.</hi> Behold the Iewiſh Church even at her loweſt ebbe. <hi>Chriſt's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59494:19"/> Church</hi> is the Miſtris and of higher dignity. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore at all times after her beginning, you muſt find me at leſt as many viſible Profeſſors of her doctrine as the Iewiſh Church had in her meaneſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>For the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is eſtablished in far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promiſſes.</hi> Heb. 8.6. As alſo appeares by the texts which here ſhall be cited. All which texts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vince ſuch a perpetuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpicuous, and viſibly floriſhing ſtate at all times that no church, differing from the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſhewed to have had any thing like it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The other only conſiderable objection is, that perhapes theſe promiſes, made by God to his Church concerning his allwaiſe protecting her, were made upon this condition, that he would do this, if ſhe ſhould perſever to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſo all his promiſes to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> are made. I anſwer that it is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which feeme made to them, and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are not to be litterally underſtood of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity according to fleſh, but as they, by grace, be ſonnes of Chriſt, who was the ſonne of David. And diverſe of theſe promiſes are made ſo abſolutly, that abſolutely they admit of no ſuch condition. Take for proof hereof that convincing Text Pſ. 89.4. <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen, I have ſworne to David my ſervant, thy ſeed will I eſtablish for ever, and I will build up thy throne to all generations. All which is only verified in Chriſt</hi> Who, in his Church, <hi>hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

After this promiſe of everlaſting perpetuity to his Church, leſt any ony ſhould thinke his promiſes might be made void by any ſins of hers, or to be made only upon condition, of theyr walking in his commandments, he addeth in the ſame Pſ. v. 29. <hi>And I will putt him the firſt begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> high aboue the kings of the earth, I will keepe my mercy unto him for ever, and my Teſtament faithfull unto him. I will putt his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for ever, and ever, and his throne as the days of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But if his Children shall forſake my law</hi> (this can not be poſſibly, in your doctrine ſpoken of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) <hi>and will not walke in my Iudgments. If they will prophane my Iuſtices, and not keep my commandments, I wil viſit theyr iniquities with a Rod, and theyr ſinnes with ſtripes. But my loving kindneſs I will not take a way from him; nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will I not break nor the thing which is gone out of my Lips. Once I have ſworn in my holy, if I ly to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; his ſeed shall continue for ever. And his throne as the Sun in my ſight, and as the Moon perfect for ever.</hi> This Text ſpeakes home to prove what I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to witt, that theſe promiſes, be made upon Chriſt. <hi>The ſon of David the ſon of Abraham</hi> Matth 1.1. and, as S. Paul teacheth that only thoſe who believe in Chriſt be the rue children of Iſraël, and Abraham, ſo they only be the true children of David, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them is verified the promiſe which (as is here ſayed) for no fins of theirs shall ever be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Not as though the word of God had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no effect but <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59494:20"/> they that are the Children of the Promiſſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> Rom. 9.6.</p>

               <p>There is litle need to paſſe to the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the old ſufficing, if any thing will ſuffice. Of Chriſts Goſpell S. Paul ſays

I inſiſt not in the known places, as, that the Church Matth. 16.18. <hi>Is built upon a Rock &amp; that the Gates of Hell shall not provaile againſt it.</hi> Again it is evident that ſhe muſt ſtill be viſible in all ages that we <hi>may ſtill</hi> at any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<hi>Tell the Church</hi> and <hi>heare her.</hi> Matth. 18.17. and be ſtill
<hi>fedd by her</hi> Doctrine and Sacraments. For theſe be the two eſſentiall markes of a true Church as Proteſtants ſay. Hence Epheſ. Chap. 4 v. 11 <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and other ſome Evangeliſts, and other ſome Paſtors and Doctors &amp;c. untill we meete al in the unity of faith,</hi> which will not be till the worlds end.
<hi>Theſe be the light of the world, ſtill ſett upon the candleſtickes never hidd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a buſshel.</hi> Matth. 5.14. A Cittie upon a hill ſtill to be ſeen. <hi>And though the muſtard ſeede was the leſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59494:23"/> at the beginning, yet in the growing it proves a Tree, and all fowles repaire to it.</hi> Matth. 13.32. Yea this muſt be a Church perpetually continuing in ſuch reverence to our B.

<hi>even to the end of the world.</hi> The promiſe therefore is, to be with them, in the perſons of ſuch as ſhould ſucced them in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and preaching, &amp;c.

               <p>All theſe Texts demonſtrate what we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to prove. And hence it doth unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow that the Chureh muſt in all ages have a continuall ſucceſſion of true Preachers of the word of God, and true adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for theſe two things (even according to the 39. Articles of the Church of England) are the two eſſentiall ſignes or notes of a true Church, which muſt ever accompany her in all ages. And if a Church be (as S.

A thing which evidently muſt be verified in the true Church, and yet is is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that this only is verified in the Roman Church; that is, no Church (but ſuch as was ioyned to her in communion) euer converted any one pariſh of Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Texts which evidence this vaſt extent of the true Church are Gen. 13.16. <hi>I will make thy ſeed as the duſt of the earth:</hi> And C. 15. v. 5. <hi>Looke up to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and number the ſtars if thou canſt.

                  <hi>THE FIFT POINT.</hi> Of the infallibility of the Church and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of her fitnes to be judge of controverſies.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOte that in two manners or wayes things of beleefe, and practice may be delivered by a community. The firſt is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch things, once received by the ſayd Community, are perpetually retained by the ſame in all places by the publick practice, and alſo, upon all occaſions, taught by word of mouth, and expreſſed in written bookes. Thus our common law in England (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver written by any lawmaker) is notwithſtanding by dayly practice, moſt faithfully kept, and hath been ſo for ſo many hundred yeares by the whole Nation diffuſed. And in this manner the Church diffuſed keepeth in perpetuall practice, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth to her children, as infallible truth what was firſt delivered unto her, by commiſſion from God either in writing, or by word of mouth. The other way of making and delivering Laws is to call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather the represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tative body of the Community. So here in England our ſtatute laws are made, not onely by the King, nor onely by the Parlament but by the order both of King and Parlament. And what is thus enacted is the decree of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59494:29"/> repreſentative. Now as the repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tative of our nation is the King and Parlament; ſo the Church Repreſentative is the chiefe Paſtour thereof toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ather with a Lawfull generall Councill. And the definitions, and decrees ſet forth by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be called the definitions, and the decrees of the Church Repreſentative. All ſuch definitions we Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholicks hold infallible. Whither the definition of a Councill alone, defining without their chiefe Paſtour, or the definitions of the chiefe Paſtour alone, defining without a Councill, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or no, there be ſeverall opinions amongſt us; in which we do and may varie without any prejudice to our Faith, which is not built upon what is yet under opinion, but upon that which is delivered as infallible; and we all unanimouſly hold that to be ſo, which the univerſall Church Repreſentatiue, conſiſting joyntly of the chiefe Paſtour of the ſayd Church voting in, and with a Generall Councell; not that this Repreſentatiue made wholy of men, is not, of its owne nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour. For this we never affirme. And ſo our adverſaries ſay nothing at all to the purpoſe, whilſt they labour to proue this. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſproue, if they can (and that out of Scripture alone) that which we ſay, to witt: that this Church Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue is infallible meerly, and purely by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall aſſiſtance of the Divine Provedence, always affording to his Church a ſufficient meaſure <hi>of the <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59494:30"/> ſpirit of truth to lead her into all truth.</hi> And that he is evcr ſo ſurely reſolved to do this that no ſinns of his Church ſhall ever hinder him from doeing of it, as is moſt expresſly delivered by God himſelfe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89. in the words cited by me at large
<hi>Point</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 3. Which place the Reader ſhall find moſt convincing to prove, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſinns that ſhall euer happen in his Church, the ſunne and moone ſhall ſooner faile then God will faile to provide a ſucceſſour in Chriſts throne, to governe his Church in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of truth, ſo as <hi>his faithfulnes shall not faile nor none of his words be fruſtrated,</hi> which you ſhall ſee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered again and again in the enſueing places of Scripture. All which (to the number of thirty) I gather to fully, becauſe the Proteſtants exclaime againeſt nothing more then the Churches claime to infallibility, which D. Ferne calls. <hi>The very bane of Chriſtendome</hi> though it be the very ground wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Chriſtianity. For all interpretation of Serip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fallible, if the interpretation of the Church be fallible, euen then, when ſhe hath carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Scripture with Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to avoide confuſion, I will divide theſe thirty Texts, into theſe three ſeverall ſorts, <hi>The firſt ſort</hi> ſhall containe eyther ſuch as command vs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly to follow, and obey the Church, in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as would wholy misbeſeeme God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs, if ſhe could thruſt errours vpon vs for <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59494:30"/> Divine verities, or ſuch Texts, as theach vs to relie more vpon the Church then could prudently be done, if ſhe could teach errour. <hi>The ſecond ſort</hi> ſhall containe a multitude of ſuch glorious expreſſions made every where of the Church, as would be moſt emptie and truthleſſe if the Church ſhould ever prove a Miſtris of errours and preſſe them on her children for Divine verities. <hi>The third and laſt ſort</hi> ſhall be ſuch Texts as plainly affirme Truth to be ſtill taught in the Church, and to be intailed vpon her, promiſing ſhe ſhall not revolt from it, but ſtand ſtill a true piller and ground of Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Of the firſt ſort of Texts</hi> we haue theſe by which eyther God commaundes vs vniverſally to follow his Church, or ſpeakes that of his Church, which could not be delivered as it is, if this Church could erre, For example: how could God glorie in the multitude of ſuch as follow his Church, if, by ſo doeing, they ſhould be led into errour. And yet <hi>Iſaias</hi> 2. God ſeemes to glorie in the multitude of thoſe who confidently reſort to the Church, as to a Miſtris of aſſured Truth, to be inſtructed by her ſaying v. 3. <hi>Let us goe vp to the mountaine of our Lord, and he wil teach us his wayes and we shall walke in his pathes, and he shall judge among the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> Behold Chriſt erecting a Court or tribunal in his Church <hi>to judge amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d decide all their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies which muſt needs ſuppoſe obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be yeilded to this judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Yea the ſame Prophet adds c. 54. v. 17. that <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt thee shall <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59494:31"/> proſper: and every tongue reſiſting thee in judgment thou shalt condemne.</hi> And the Prophet there from the beginning manifeſtly ſpeakes of Chriſts Church.
<hi>Thirdly.</hi> Iſaias Ch. 60.12. <hi>The Nation and Kingdome that will not ſerve thee, shall perish.</hi> Vnder paine <hi>of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing</hi> the Church muſt be obeyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whence. <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rthly,</hi> Ezech: c: 44. v. 23.
<hi>They</hi> (that is the Prieſts) <hi>shall teach the people what is between a holy thing, and a thing polluted, and the difference between cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ane, and vncleane. They shall shew them, and when there shall be controverſie, they shall ſtand in judgment, and shall judge according to my judgments.</hi> This being their office, the peoples office muſt needs be, not to jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge them, but obey them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whence. <hi>Fiftly.</hi> Chriſt (Matt. 18.17.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all to obey the Church vnder paine of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held here on earth, as
<hi>Publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Heathens,</hi> and of haveing this ſentence ratifyed in heauen. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>and if he will not heare the Church let him be vnto thee as a Heathen, and a Publican. Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay vnto you whatſoever you shall bind on Earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever you shall looſe vpon earth, shall be looſed alſo in heaven.</hi> Here you ſee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be yeilded vnder paine of being held
<hi>as a Publican or an Heathen,</hi> and this ſentence to be ratified in heaven. Now if the Church could erre in theaching (for example) that Chriſt is truly preſent in the Sacrament, and hence oblige all to adore him there in, as much as they adore him in <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59494:31"/> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and could oblige them to this vnder paine of being held as Publicans and Heathens, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d held ſo as well in heaven, as vpon earth; ſurely this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an errour. For then in heaven this ſentence would never be ratified. And tell me not, that this texts ſpeakes of private differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces betweene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d brother, though I denie not but this is alſo true, in ſuch differences as belong to the Court or Tribunall of the Church: yet hence evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that this Text doth much more concerne thoſe differences in point of Religion, between brother, and brother. Both becauſe theſe doe more properly belong to the Court of the Church, and to her Tribunall: as alſo becauſe when ſcandal, and offence is giuen to our brother in point of hereſie, tending to the ſeduction of his ſoule; our brother ſeeing this ſoule-murthering ſinne broached to his owne ruine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the eternall ruine of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath farre greater reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this caſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other, <hi>to tell the Church</hi> his mother, to whome, in this difference, aboue all other
<hi>differences,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongeth to looke to the ſafety of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. For this is an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſcandal to the whole brotherhood of all Chriſtianity. Therefore, in theſe points of higheſt concernement, we are moſt bound to <hi>heare the Church</hi> vnder paine of being accounted
<hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and of haueing this heauie ſentence
<hi>ratified in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Sixtly. Matt. 23.1. Then Ieſus ſpake to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59494:32"/> multitudes and to his Diſciples: ſaying. <hi>Vpon the chaire of Moyſes haue ſitten the Scribes and Phariſes</hi> (by which ſitting, with lawfull ſucceſſion, they as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as they were, are knowne to be lawfully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Prelats) <hi>all therefore whatſoever they shall ſay unto you obſerve, and do.</hi> Behold here a precept of obeying in <hi>all whatſoever.</hi> And therefore behold a precept, which could not be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if that, which is delivered by publicke authority of the Church, were not ſecured from error in <hi>all whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sevently.</hi> The firſt and beſt Chriſtians did practically acknowledge theyr beleefe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church. For, to have a deciſion of the moſt important Controverſies (Act. 15.2.)
<hi>they appointed Paul and Barnabas to go up, and certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne others of the reſt, to the Apoſtles, and Prieſts unto Hieruſalem upon this queſtion.</hi> And the Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the firſt Councill, in which, though this Councill were aſſiſted with the Holy Ghoſt; yet <hi>there was made a great diſputation.</hi> v. 7. And then the definition of the Church came forth in theſe words, <hi>It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt, and us.</hi> v. 28. Other lawfull Councills, knowing the Holy Ghoſt allſo promiſed to them do vſe to ſet forth theyr definitions with the ſame words, and this moſt agreable to Scripture. For Iohn 15. v. 26. <hi>When the Paraclete cometh, whom I shall ſend from my father, the ſpirit of truth, he shall give teſtimonie of me, and you shall give teſtimonie.</hi> Marke this conjunction of <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59494:32"/> (he) and (you) He the <hi>the ſpirit of truth,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> Governers of my Church; ſo that you in giveing teſtimony may freely ſay. <hi>It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt, and us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Eightly.</hi> It is cleere out of Scripture that the firſt Chriſtians were ſo fully poſſeſſed with the beleefe of the infallibility of the Church, that they would beleeve nothing but what thy knew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to her doctrine. S. Paul was a Scripture-writer, and ſo great an Apoſtle, and yet he ſayeth of himſelfe Gal. 2.1. <hi>Then after fourteene yeares I went to Hieruſalem again</hi> (not meerly to ſatisfie a vaine fancie of ſome particular men: but) <hi>I went up according to revelation, and conferred with them the Ghoſpel, which I preach among the Gentills. But</hi> (I conferred) <hi>ſeverally (or a part) with them that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſomething, leaſt perhaps I should runn, or had runn in vain.</hi> So that he thought all his <hi>fourteen yeares</hi> preaching, and allſo his future preaching might come to be <hi>in vaine,</hi> vnleſſe, even his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were made known to be approved by the Church, as wholy conformable to the Church. So much, in theſe goulden dayes, were the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians taught to relye vpon the Church; which had been imprudence, if ſhe had been fallible. Yet we muſt not thinke that then they did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that the approbation of the Church did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de any degree of truth to his doctrine, as it doth not add any degree of truth to the Scripture, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59494:33"/> pretend to have power to change, or correct true Scripture. And ſo S. Paul ſayth, v. 6. <hi>For to me, they that ſeemed to be ſome thing, added nothing.</hi> For as the toutchſtone adds no value to the gold, but onely evidently manifeſteth which is true gold, which not: ſo the Church, as then, did only mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt infallibly the truth, of what he had preached. So allſo the Church, as now, doth only manifeſt to vs, that ſuch, and ſuch Bookes be the true word of God, ſuch, and ſuch be not; ſuch be true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, ſuch not &amp;c. But the word of God hath its true worth from it ſelfe, and not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church, as the gold hath its being true gold from it ſelfe and not from the toutchſtone. So when Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques ſay with S. Aug. Cont. Epiſt. fundam. c. 5. <hi>I would not beleeve the Ghoſpell unleſſe the authoritie of the Church moved me,</hi> they doe not meane, that the Church can adde, or take away from the truth of any true Scripture; but they meane, that, by her definition, as by a Sure touchſtone, it is now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly aſſured vnto them, that ſuch a booke is true Scripture, and ſuch not. And as the orall preaching (even of ſuch an Apoſtle as had been a Scripture writer) might have been <hi>in vain,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this approbation; ſo allſo might his writings have been in vaine. Whence we ſee that his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnto the Hebrews was not known or acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged as Gods word, vntill the Church appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. If the Scripture writer himſelfe teacheth <hi>in <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59494:33"/> vaine</hi> without this approbation, much more will his writings teach in vaine.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Ninthly.</hi> The Church is to be followed by vs as an aſſured approver or reprover of ſpirits and conſequently as infallible. Iohn 1.4. <hi>My deareſt beleeve not every ſpirit but prove the ſpirits if they be of God:</hi> then v. 6. <hi>We are of God; he that knows God heares us</hi> (Paſtours of Church) <hi>he that is not of God heares us not. In this we know the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of errour.</hi> Here S. Iohn expreſly meanes to give to poſterity a <hi>ſtanding Rule</hi> to know a true ſpirit from a falſe one. To witt: <hi>By the hearing of us, or not hearing of us.</hi> This could not be a Rule to vs, who live after the Apoſtles, if by <hi>hearing us</hi> he onely meant the Apoſtles, and not theyr ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. Yea he could not meane onely the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. For the other Apoſtles were all dead when he wrote this. Wherefore, the true ſence of S. Iohn is. <hi>In this we know the ſpirit of truth and the ſpirit of errour, if they heare us.</hi> Paſtours, and Governours of the Church. Not that each one of theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and Governours a part can ſay to any one <hi>heare me,</hi> vnleſſe he teach that which all the reſt are ſufficiently knowne to teach, but they in a Generall Councill may moſt truely ſay. <hi>Heare us.</hi> He that knows God heareth us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Tenthly.</hi> In declaring the true meaning of the true Scriptures, the practiſe and doctrine of the Church is neceſſary to be followed as a <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59494:34"/> certaine Guide. For example. When Chriſt ſayd. <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> He did impoſe, ſayth the Church, a true commaund to doe ſo. Yet, though Chriſt, no leſſe cleerly, ſayd (Iohn 13.14.) <hi>That we ought to wash one anothers feete, for I have given you an example that as I have done.

               <p n="20">20. <hi>Seaventhly:</hi> Matth. 16.18. <hi>The gates of Hell shall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> If Hell could ever come to make the Church a Miſtris of errours ſo as to hold them forth for divine verities ſo many ages togeather, the gates of Hell ſhould highly prevaile againſt her. Now I pray note, that for many ages, there were no Chriſtians, which were not eyther manifeſt Hereticks (and held ſo by the Proteſtants themſelves) or which did not (as all Roman Catholicks now doe) worſhip, and adore Chriſt, as much vnder the ſhape of bread in the Euchariſt, as they worſhip him ſitting at the right hand of his father. If this be Idolatry the gates of Hell have prevailed againſt the Roman Church: yea and againſt the Churches in <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> &amp;c. who all, ever ſince they were Chriſtians, have held this our doctrine, and doe ſtill hold it, though they adde a world of other errors. Where then ſhall the Proteſtants find Chriſt a Church againſt, which the gates of Hell have not a vaſt long time togeather prevailed? They muſt eyther be forced to make Chriſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in this his doctrine, or to confeſſe our doctrine true. If it be not; how was this <hi>Covenant everlaſting</hi> 
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59494:38"/> as hath been ſo often ſayd in the now cited Texts? and allſo the Text following in which Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the
<hi>everlaſting Covenant</hi> formerly promiſed to be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly:</hi> S. Iohn Ch. 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>And he will give you an other Paraclete that may abide with you for ever, the ſpirit of Truth, whome the world knows not: but you know him, becauſe he dwells with you, and shall be in you.</hi> Now the Apoſtles not being to be <hi>for ever,</hi> and the ſpirit of Truth being promiſed <hi>for ever,</hi> we cannot but ſay that the promiſe of this <hi>ſpirit of Truth</hi> is made alſo to the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, the Governours of Chriſts Church, to <hi>abide in them, and be in them, as the ſpirit of Truth,</hi> directly oppoſite to the ſpirit of errour. So <hi>ninthly.</hi> Iohn 16.12.
<hi>Many things I have to ſay unto you but you cannot beare them now</hi> (hence appeares how weighty thoſe thinghs were) <hi>but when the ſpirit of Truth cometh, he will guide you into all Truth</hi> To private perſons the Holy Ghoſt is given as the ſpirit of ſanctification but to the Church he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the <hi>ſpirit of Truth guiding her into all Truth</hi> and ſo directly excluding all errour from her.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Tenthly:</hi> that convincing place of S. Paul ſhall end all theſe Texts: 1. Tim. 3.15. where ſpeaking of the viſible Church in which he teac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth Timothie how to Converſe the ſpeakes thus.
<hi>That thou mayſt know how to behave thy ſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the liveing God, <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59494:38"/> the Pillar and ground of Truth</hi> Can I leane more aſſuredly then vpon the Pillar of Truth? Can I even wiſh, to have a ſurer ground, then the <hi>ground of Truth?</hi> And yet ſuch a ground is the Church acknowledged in this Text, if it be not perverted by ſuch interpretations as be the inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but of men vnable to confirme theyr interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any Text clearer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. Here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behold we have produced no fewer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>thirty texts</hi> for the infallibility of the Church. Whereas not halfe ſo many nor halfe ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vincing Texts ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be alleaged againſt it. And yet gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this, and you muſt gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all. Note that beſides theſe 30. Texts here alledged, I have allſo all thoſe numerous and moſt full Texts related at large Point 3. For whatſoever proves that the true Church cannot faile to be a true church, proves allſo her infallibility. For truth of doctrine is eſſentiall to a true Church. If the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore by being fallible and erring the whole Church could recede from the true doctrine of Chriſt, it manifeſtly follows that the whole Church could faile to be a true Church contrary to theſe moſt expreſſe Scriptures there plentifully alledged.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Moſt impertinent is the diſtinction, which our adverſaries uſe, to avoide the force of theſe Texts. They ſay that the Church may be taken in two wayes: firſt for the viſible Church, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all beleevers, as well reprobate, as elect: and <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59494:39"/> this Church they ſay may erre. Secondly for the inviſible Church, which only containes the elect: and this they ſay cannot erre. But this is a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contradiction if well noted. For this inviſible Church of the elect, which, as you ſay, cannot er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, is contained in the viſible Church, in which, as you ſay, both reprobate, and elect are contained: which viſible Church (you allſo ſay) may wholy erre. But if the whole viſible Church wholy erre then allſo the elect (contained in it) may erre: or if they cannot erre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many in the viſible Church cannot erre. And yet you cannot find many, in any Church viſible vpon earth, whome you can ſhew on the one ſide to have differed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the Roman Church, and on the other to have been guarded from errour, as thoſe, who make the true Church, muſt be. Again I have ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that many Texts here by me cited ſpeake clearly of the viſible Church.</p>

               <p n="3">3. My demonſtration is this. No Church can be the true infallible Church, and decider of all Controverſies which teacheth herſelfe to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if any ſuch Church be infallible in all that ſhe teacheth; ſhe is infallible allſo in teaching herſelfe to be fallible. And hence it followeth that infallibly ſuch a Church is fallible: but every Church in the world but the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teacheth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be fallible: wherefore (by evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration) <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59494:40"/> no other Church, upon earth, can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.

But he had but <hi>part of his glory,</hi> ſo Num. 27. v. 18. <hi>Take Ioſue the ſone of Nun a man in whome it the ſpirit, and put thy hand upon him, who shall ſtand before Eliazar Prieſt, and thou (ô Moyſes) shalt put ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of thine honour upon him.</hi> Now the one part of Moyſes his honour was to be a ſecular Prince and commander in chiefe. In this dignity, Ioſue did ſucceed him. But in Levit. Ch. 8. God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Moyſes to inueſt Aaron with the other part
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59494:41"/> of his dignity, which was to be High Prieſt. But when Aaron now came to dye, God ſayd to Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Num. 20.26. <hi>Take Aaron and his ſonne with him and when thou haſt unveſted the father of his veſtiture, thou shalt reveſt therewith Eleazar his ſonne, Moyſes did as our Lord commanded him.</hi> And thus ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely God provided his Church of high Prieſts. Neither (for the wikedneſs of any of them) did he ceaſe to governe his Church by them, even by heavenly and ſupernaturall aſſiſtance. As bad, as Cayphas was, yet, becauſe he was the high Prieſt, he did propheſy Io. 11.51. <hi>He ſayd not this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but beeing the high Prieſt of that yeare, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed that Ieſus should dye for the Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The old law beeing now transferred to the new, it was neceſſary that the Prieſthood all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhould be transferred, theſe two going toga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.12. wherefore the new law beeing the Lady, the old the hand maide as S. Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes; the new law allſo, according to him beeing <hi>eſtablished upon better promiſſes.</hi> Hebr.
8.6. we may, with all ground in Scripture, expect to ſee Chriſts church ever provided of ſuch high Prieſts, as ſhall, by his bounty, have many advantages above the high Prieſts of the old law. Chriſt then inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to build his new church, he called to him even amongſt the firſt of his Apoſtles <hi>Simon</hi> and preſently changed his name into
<hi>Cephas;</hi> which is interpreted <hi>Peter,</hi> a <hi>Rock</hi> Io. 1.42. To this Simon <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59494:42"/> Matth. 16.18. he ſayth: <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> which in that language, which Chriſt ſpoke, is as much, as to ſay: <hi>Thou art a Rock, and vpon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> The wiſeſt of men deſignes a ſure Rock for the everſtanding building of his church in the midſt of all windes and waves, &amp; if any one ſay that Chriſt himſelfe is a <hi>Rock</hi> ſo as not to communicate this Rock-like firmity of his allſo to S. Peter, he flatly contradicts Chriſts ſaying: <hi>Thou art a Rock, and upon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> If any man ſhould take a fayre ſtone in his hand, and ſay: <hi>Thou art a fayre goodly ſolid ſtone, and upon this ſtone I intend to rayſe a Chappel.</hi> Who would conceive this man in the laſt part of his ſpeach to point at any other ſtone the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which he had in his hand? True it is that Chriſt is the fundation; yet with out any diſhonour to him, (nay to the increaſe of his honour) he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth that very title of fundation to others. So Eph. 2.20. we are ſayd: <hi>Built upon the fundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets: Ieſus Chriſt beeing the thiefe corner ſtone.</hi> Chriſt then is the chiefe Rock of an everlaſting perpetuity, and this by his owne vertue. S. Peter is a Rock ſtanding firme ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, not by his owne vertue, but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt, and made thus not for his owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke but for Chriſts churches ſake, Chriſt intending that this his church ſhould ſtand for ever as I proved Point 3. Whence Chriſt adds <hi>upon this <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59494:42"/> Rock I will build my Church.</hi> We willingly gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the church was to be built, not upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of S. Peter but vpon his faith; yet his faith muſt not be taken as ſeparated from his perſon, but it muſt be taken as the thing chiefly regarded in his perſon; for which to him perſonally this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was given: yet given chiefly for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good of the church to be built upon him. Wherefore leſt the building ſhould be ſhattered at his death, this firme perpetuity of a Rock, that is this <hi>ſaith of his which Chriſt prayed should never fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</hi> Luc. 22.32. was to be derived to his lawfull ſucceſſors: as the chaire of Moyſes ever had the ſucceſſors of Moyſes ſitting in it: for no well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered common wealth is deſtitute of ſufficient meanes, ſtill to provide her of her lawfull Heads and Governours appointed her ſucceſſively. And as it is not enough to ſay,
<hi>Chriſt is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords</hi> therefore the civil commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth needs no other King or Lord. So it ſeems farr greater non-ſenſe to ſay, that becauſe Chriſt is the chiefe head, and Prieſt of the church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we, vpon earth, need no other head to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne ſuch a common wealth as the Church is, conteining ſo many ſeverall people, of ſo many nations, natures, cuſtomes, and diſpoſitions, as be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riſing of the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, to the going downe of the ſame, though this ſo farr ſpread common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were intended, from the beginning, to laſt <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59494:43"/> as long as the Sunne and Moone. It was then for this, his churches ſake, that ſome one was ever to be firſt and Chiefe in it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now ſayth S. Matthew numbring the Apoſtles (Princes of the Church) <hi>The names of the twelve Apoſtles be theſe, The firſt, Simon, who is called Peter.</hi> Matth. 10.2. And ſo in all places where the Apoſtles are counted, as Iudas is allwaiſe the laſt, ſo S. Peter is counted firſt: and as it was ſayd of <hi>Eliazar that he was the Prince of Princes of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> Num. 3.32. So amongſt the ſpirituall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſts Church, S. Matthew doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly count him firſt, but plainly ſays he was <hi>the firſt The firſt Simon who is called Peter.</hi> He was neither <hi>the firſt</hi> in order of calling to the Apoſtle ſhipe, nor in age. For his Brother Andrew was before him in both theſe, Io. 1. Again to ſignifie that he was the head and chiefe in ordinary; Chriſt ſayd to him Matth. 16.19. <hi>And to thee will I give the Keyes of the Kingdome of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For though the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of looſing, and binding was afterward given to the other Apoſtles, Iohn 20.23. yet the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven</hi> are never in Scripture, ſayd to be given to any but to S. Peter. The gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Keyes, is wel knowne to ſignifie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſupreme Rule in a citty, or familie. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Keyes of the citty are offered to the chiefe Governours at theyr entrance. So allſo <hi>the Keye of the houſe of David</hi> is given to Chriſt <hi>being to reigne <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59494:43"/> in the houſe of David for ever.</hi> Here Chriſt giveth the Keyes to S. Peter as to his ſucceſſor <hi>in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God.</hi> 1. Tim. 3.15. By theſe Keyes is ſignified the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of higheſt power.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again Iohn 21.15. <hi>Simon of Iohn loveſt thou me more then theſe? Feed my lambes.</hi> And yet again, v. 17. <hi>Feed my sheepe.</hi> Note that he would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve required <hi>greater love</hi> in Peter, rather then in any of the reſt nor have ſayd <hi>loveſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> if he had not here intended to give him higher dignity in Paſtorſhip then to the reſt. If every one of the other Apoſtles be ſheep of Chriſt S. Peter is here made Paſtor to every one of them for he is commanded <hi>to feed them.</hi> Note again (and principally) that the whole flocke of Chriſt <hi>his lambes, his sheepe,</hi> his ſubjects and theyr Rulers, did not conſiſt of thoſe only men who then lived, but much more of all ſuch faithfull men as were to be of the flock and Church of Chriſt, even from his days to the end of the world. Wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re this high Paſtorſhip beeing as we ſayd chiefly inſtituted by Chriſt, out of his love and care to his flock, and not meerly out of the deſire of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring S. Peter, was by ordinary courſe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to be, devolved to all poſterity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And that no man ſhould ſay that this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhall everfaile, Thus ſayth our Lord (Ier. 33.17.)
<hi>David shall never want a man to fitt upon <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59494:44"/> the throne of the houſe of Iſraël, and of the Prieſts and Levits there shall not faile a man &amp;c.</hi> And he adds <hi>that his Covenant should ſooner be made void with the day and the night then his Covenant should be made voide with David his ſervant. That there be not of him a ſonne to reigne in his throne and Levits and Prieſts his Miniſters.</hi> And the Prophet Eſau in his laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tells us that in the new law theſe Levits ſhall not be borne Levits of the Tribe of Levi or any particular Tribe or Nation, but by election, they ſhall be choſen to be Levits out of ſeverall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions particularly of <hi>Italians, Graecians, Affricans,</hi> and the
<hi>Ilands</hi> a farre of; though the Engliſh Bible doth not tranſlate theſe names, <hi>I will take</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>of them to be Prieſts and Levits.</hi> But ſhall there not ſtill be one chiefe Paſtour of theſe never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying races of Prieſts and Levits? yes there ſhall,
<hi>And they shall have one shepherd or Paſtor over them all.</hi> Ezech.

               <head>
                  <hi>THE EIGHT POINT.</hi> That this our chiefe Paſtor, or Pope is not Anti-chriſt.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BEcauſe there is never a pulpit in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in which the Pope hath not been preached, by all our Miniſters to be not only Anti-chriſt, <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59494:44"/> but allſo <hi>the Anti-chriſt,</hi> who is ſo much ſpoken of and deteſted in Scriptures, I thought fitt to make my deare country men ſee with theyr own eyes, how unconſcionably theſe theyr Miniſters ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally deale with them in this point, in which they can not but ſee (if indeede they reade and will underſtand) how flatly, and point blank this doctrine is againſt moſt manifeſt Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Scripture teacheth clearly that Anti-chriſt is one particulare determinate man, and not any ranke of ſeverall diſtinct men ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively living one after the other as Popes do. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce 2. Theſſ. 2.3. Anti-chriſt is called <hi>That man of ſin the ſonne of perdition. The adverſary.</hi> And Apoc. 13.14. An image ſhall be made of this particular perſon, where as no ſuch image can repreſent thoſe hundreds of Popes who have ſitt in S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire. Again there it followeth that this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man ſhall have a ſpeciall name, and ſuch a peculiar number ſhall expreſſe this name: <hi>For it is the number of a man.</hi> A man, I ſay and not many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſucceeding one an other as Popes are. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it followeth. <hi>The number of him is ſix hundred ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix.</hi> Of that <hi>Him,</hi> whom Chriſt allſo inſinuated to be one particular <hi>man</hi> when he ſayed Io. 5.43. <hi>If an other shall come in his Name him you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave.</hi> Whereas no one of the Popes was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved by the Iewes. Wherefore of the Pope it is falſe to ſay the Iewes <hi>have received him.</hi> And this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59494:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> is the ſecond reaſon why the Pope according to Scripture is not Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this one particular man ſhall not come untill we be cloſe bordering upon the very laſt end of the world. Mark
13.24. <hi>But in thoſe days after that tribulation</hi> (of Anti-chriſt)
<hi>the Sunne shall be darkned.</hi> Popes have beene ever ſince S. Peters days, and that which you all call Popery hath beene (as you confeſs) above theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares and yet the Sunne ſhines upon the world as clearely as ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this one ſpeciall man ſhall reigne but a ſhort time, where as theſe Popes (upholders of confeſſed Popery) have reigned theſe many Ages. Anti-chriſt ſhall reigne but three yeares and a half, <hi>a time, and times, and halfe a time.</hi> Dan. 7.25. And Apoc. 12.14. Hence Dan. 12.11. this time is further expounded to be <hi>a thouſand two hundred and nynety days.</hi> And the Church a litle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this perſecution began, ſhall fly into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe <hi>for a thouſand two hundred and ſixty days.</hi> And for this time of 1260. <hi>days the two wittneſſes shall propheſy.</hi> Apoc. 11.3. For the perſecution of Anti-chriſt ſhall laſt but <hi>two and fourty months</hi> as it there expreſſy ſayd. And Apoc. 13.5. <hi>Power was given (to the beaſt) to continue two and fourty months.</hi> The time therefore of Anti-chriſts reigne ſhall be ſhort. <hi>For the elect the days shall be shortned</hi> Matth. 24.22. So Apoc. 20.3. it is ſayed that <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59494:45"/> the diuel ſhall be lett looſe for the ſhort time of Anti-chriſts reigne.
<hi>After theſe things he muſt be looſened a litle time.</hi> That is after Chriſt hath bound up the divel, during the long time of the new Teſtament (deſcribed there by the complete and perfect number of a thouſand yeares) he ſhall be lett looſe for the ſhort time of the reigne of Anti-Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> all the Miniſters in England, or out of England, can never be able to ſhew that the Pope did ever kill two ſuch wittneſſes as Anti-chriſt is clearly ſayd to kill Apoc. 11.6. That is
<hi>two witneſſes who shall propheſy one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days cloathed in ſackloath, who shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve power to shutt the heavens that it may not raine in the days of there propheſy; and power of the waters to turne them into bloud. And to ſtrike the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</hi> If your Miniſters will prove the Pope to be Antichriſt they muſt not only proue that he did kill two ſuch witneſſes, as they are (for the true Anti-chriſt muſt doe this) but allſo they muſt prove that the Pope did kill two ſuch witneſſes in
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> leaving theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes lying in the ſtreets thereof. For this allſo the true Anti-chriſt muſt do, becauſe it followeth v. 7.
<hi>The beaſt shall kill them. And theyre bodyes shall lye in the ſtreetes where theyr Lord was crucified,</hi> that is in Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sixtly.</hi> Hence appeares that the chiefe ſeate
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59494:46"/> of Anti-chriſt ſhall be at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> where he ſhall moſt ſhew his power and glory whence it was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſayd before that the Iewes ſhould receave him, and the Holy Fathers commonly ſay he ſhall be borne a Iew, of the Tribe of Dan, which is the cauſe why that Tribe was not numbred with the reſt Apoc. 7. neither could the Iewes receave him if he were not borne a Iew. None of theſe things agree to the Pope and yet they all agree to Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> the beaſt which ſhall ſett up the power of Antichriſt <hi>shall make fyre come downe from heaven to earth in the ſight of men. Apoc.</hi> 13.13. Tell me what ſetter up of the Popes power did ever doe this?</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Eightly</hi> there allſo v. 17. it is ſayd that he alſo ſhall effect <hi>that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall buy or ſell but he that hath the Character or name of the beaſt or number of his name.</hi> In what Popes dayes was this verified?</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Ninthly</hi> and laſtly 2. Theſſ. 2.4. That one ſpeciall man, (who is called <hi>that man of ſin) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled above all that is called God or</hi> (all) <hi>that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiped.</hi> Now whoſever is extolled above <hi>all that is God,</hi> is not only extolled above judges, and Kings, ſometimes called Gods (as all juſt men are) but
<hi>to be extolled above all that is called God,</hi> he muſt be extolled above <hi>God himſelfe,</hi> who (in the very firſt place) <hi>is called God.</hi> So he that is extolled above (all) <hi>that is worshiped</hi> muſt be extolled not only <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59494:46"/> above Princes and Kings, but above ſaints and Angels, and God himſelfe. Now neither doth the Pope extoll himſelfe or is extolled by any of his adherents above the Apoſtles or Angels, and much leſſe above God himſelfe <hi>shewing himſelfe. That he is God,</hi> as there ſayd Antichriſt shall do.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE NINTH POINT.</hi> Of the Sacraments of the Church, and of the Ceremonies which the Church u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in adminiſtrating theſe Sacraments as allſo in other occaſions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAving treated of the Church, and her chiefe Paſtor it followeth to treate of the Sacraments of this Church. And becauſe our Church uſeth ſeverall ceremonies in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of theſe Sacraments (and eſpecially in ſacrifice of the Maſſe) as allſo in other ſeverall occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (a thing much ſcoffed at by our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.) We will here allſo treate of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt then concerning Sacraments in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall before we come to treate of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sacrament to prevent miſtakes, I define a Sacrament to be <hi>An outward ſigne inſtituted by Chriſt, ſignifying the inward grace which it confers, <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59494:47"/> when duly receaved.</hi> And here it muſt be exactly noted, that every ſuch outward ſigne, or holy ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony (by the applying of which, inward grace is infallibly conferred when it is duly receaved) muſt needs be a ſigne, or ceremonie inſtituted by Chriſt. For no body but Chriſt, could annex the infallible guift of inward grace to the applying of ſuch an outward ſigne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if any one will ſtand contending to prove, that a Sacrament is ſome thing elſe, and ought to be defined otherwiſe, all that I neede to ſay in confutation of him, is that I will finde in Scripture ſeven ſuch holy ſignes or ceremonies, to the due application of which the guift of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace is infallibly annexed. And for this reaſon I ſay that theſe be either ſeuen true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe ſeven things much better then thoſe which your definition will allow to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For by theſe ſeven, that divine quality of heavenly grace is conferred; by yours it is not. But before I come to ſhew our ſeven Sacraments in particular to be ſuch holy ſignes or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies inſtituted by Chriſt (from whome all grace is derived) I will in the ſecond place treate, of the Ceremonies of the Church which Proteſtants are pleaſed to account fooliſh, Childiſh, Apiſh, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſay then that the light of reaſon teacheth us in all actions (which we deſire to rayſe above <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59494:47"/> the Rank of vulgar Actions) to deviſe ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to ſett that action forth in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that all ſhall, by the very ſight of it, be ſtirred up to apprehend ſuch an action to be farr ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ordinary things. So in the ſolemne inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of great Princes, in the coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Kings, in theyre going to ſitt in Parlaments, yea in they<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re carrying to theyre graves and interment, great choyſe is made of exquiſite ceremonies to ſett forth theſe actions; ſo that they may be rayſed much above the ſtrayne of vulgar actions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing no actions deſerve more eſteeme, or to be rayſed to a higher degree of reverence and veneration amongſt the Chriſtian people, then the chiefe actions of our Religion, it was wholy convenient that the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (beeing the chiefeſt of theſe actions) ſhould chiefly of all other actions be graced and ſett forth with ſome kinde of ceremonies, ſuch as the Church ſhould think fitteſt, that ſo all the vulgar, by the very ſight of thoſe actions, may be excited to conceave a ſacred eſteeme of thoſe actions, ſett forth ſo myſtically, in a manner quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ordinary, and vulgar actions. By this argument and not by any Text of Scripture you muſt juſtifie your Miniſters ſurplice.</p>
               <p>The law of nature (which was before the Ceremoniall law) did teach the holyeſt men of that law thus to rayſe the moſt pious actions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59494:48"/> they ſolemnly performed by addition of certaine ceremonies. So Holy Iacob Gen. 28.18. <hi>Arriſing in the morning tooke the ſtone that he had layd under his head and erected it for a title (or monument) and poured out oyle upon the toppe of it.</hi> A ceremony ſo farre from beeing ſuperſtitious that Gen. 31.13. God approves this fact appearing to Iacob and ſaying: <hi>I am the God of Bethel where thou didſt anoynt the ſtone and didſt vow thy vow to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And becauſe our adverſaries ſcoff at cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as if they were ridiculous things, we deſire them to reflect whether a heathen may not as well ſcoff at the Iewiſh Ceremonies appointed by God himſelf, as indeed the Iewes both by the Greeks and the old Romans were held for the moſt ſuperſtitious people of the world upon that account. And though the Iewiſh Ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God do now ceaſe, yet it is now blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſay any one of them were fooliſh, Apiſh, comicall geſtures. Yet looked upon with carnall eyes, they may (to the full) as much appeare to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve bin ſo, as the Ceremonies of the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to you. For example: what a mimicall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would you account it in us if we ſhould in the Conſecration of the Pope appoint that <hi>the tippe of his right eare ande the thumb and great toe of his right hand and right foot should</hi> be the parts par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly annointed and yet God himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. (Exod. 29. v. 20. That in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59494:48"/> of Aaron and his ſonnes: <hi>Thou shalt take of the blood of a Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and put it upon the tippe of the right eare of Aaron and of his ſonns and upon the thumbs and great toes of theyr right hand and foot.</hi> A number of as ſtrange Ceremonies as theſe are both in this book of Exodus and particularly in Leviticus and yet all ſet down by Gods own appointment. And it is now blaſphemy to ſay they were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But lett us paſſe to the new law though in this all Iewiſh Ceremonies be aboliſhed yet is it no where ſayd, that we ſhould ſerve God without all Ceremonies, which no nation under heaven ever did, as thoſe who are skilled in antiquity know. Yea Chriſt himſelf was pleaſed to ſett forth ſome more myſticall cures, which he did, with ſuch ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as you would ſcoff at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if our Church (in farr more myſticall actions,) had made uſe of them. So Mark 7. v. 32. in the Cure of a deaf and dumb man. Firſt <hi>he took him from the multitude a part.</hi> Secondly <hi>he putt his fingars into his eares.</hi> Thirdly <hi>ſpitting he touched his tongue.</hi> Fourthly <hi>he looked up to heaven.</hi> Fiftly
<hi>he groaned.</hi> Sixtly <hi>he uſed a word deſerving ſpeciall interpretation,</hi> ſaying <hi>Epheta</hi> that is, <hi>be opened.</hi> So allſo Iohn 8. v. 6. In pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the adultereſſe he twice <hi>bowing himſelf wrot in the earth</hi> God knows what. And in the nynth Ch. curing a man blind from his nativity v. 6. <hi>He ſpitt on the ground, and made a claye of his ſpittle then he <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59494:49"/> ſpread the clay upon his eyes.</hi> Laſtly <hi>he ſayd unto him, goe wash in the Poole Siloe which is interpreted ſent.</hi> Thus teaching his Church to uſe Ceremonies in ſuch myſterious actions as are ordeined to cure our ſpirituall deafnes, ſpirituall dumbnes, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blindnes. So we ſhall ſee it to be Scripture that ſprinkling of water muſt be uſed in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, Impoſition of hands in Confirmation and Ordination; anoynting with oyle in Extreme-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Before our Lord gave the Euchariſt to his Diſciples, he (Mark 14.) made choyſe of a roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me very ſpacious and adorned. He firſt waſhed his diſciples feete, then ſetting down he tooke bread, gave thanks, bleſſed it, brake it &amp;c. When he gave his diſciples power to abſolve and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament of Confeſſion Io. 20.22. He firſt ſayd to them. <hi>As my father ſent me ſo I ſend you, when he had ſayd this he breathed upon them and he ſayd to them. Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins yo shall forgive are forgiven &amp;c.</hi> When the Paſtors of our Church uſe the inſufflation or Breathing u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any, for the lyke myſticall ſignification you cry a lowd, ſuperſtition, ſuperſtition, an apiſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall action &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is allſo one very great commoditie in the Churches perſcribing ſuch and ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ceremonies in ſuch and ſuch actions, that hence it enſues that all her prieſts performe all theſe ſacred Rites in adminiſtring Sacraments, <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59494:49"/> offering ſacrifice &amp;c. after juſt one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame manner all the world over, which is a moſt comely and orderly thing and could not have happened, had not ſuch and ſuch peculiar Rites been preſcribed to all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But now if after that we have proved Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be reaſonable, you aske why the Church did preſcribe juſt theſe particular Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and no other? Firſt I anſwer that eyther theſe particular Ceremonies are more proper and ſeemly and as it were more connaturall to ſuch an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſecondly they are fitteſt for ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſignification. Laſtly I ſay that our unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied adverſaryes would have asked the ſelf ſame queſtion of any other particular ceremonies, if the Church had peculiarly appointed them. Even as ſome men will curiouſly be asking. Why did God make the world juſt at ſuch a particular ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and not ſooner or later? For as S. Auguſtin wittily anſwers. Had God made choiſe of any other time to make the world you would ſtill have been asking the very ſelfſame wyſe queſtion. <hi>Why juſt now and not ſooner, or later?</hi> Even ſo you would as wiſely haue been ſaying. <hi>Why juſt ſuch a Ceremonie and not as well ſuch or ſuch an one?</hi> Lett this ſuffice for the Iuſtification of our Ceremonies.</p>

For he was not come upon any of them, but they were only baptized in the name of our Lord Ieſus. Then did they impoſe theyr hands u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them</hi> (behold the outward ſigne) <hi>and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Behold the inward grace, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe, who, though they had been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, yet they had not received this particular <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59494:51"/> ſtrength, and
<hi>Confirmation</hi> of ſpeciall grace which the coming of the Holy Ghoſt in this Sacrament did bring unto them. It is allſo moſt agreable to Scripture that this Sacrament be given not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Prieſts but by Biſhops. Whence Bede ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently noteth that it was not <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle who is here ſayd to have converted <hi>Samaria</hi> but
<hi>Philip</hi> one of the ſeaven Decons.

And though here be no mention of oyle; yet it followeth not that no oyle is to be uſed in this Sacrament. For ſo in the Scripture there is no mention of water, in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Text which mentions the inſtitution of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as Matthew the laſt <hi>Teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Yet the practice of the Church, teſtifyed by all antiquity, ſufficiently teacheth the uſe of oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, or Holy Chriſme in this Sacrament See the Remiſh Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t upon the place of the Acts now cited.

               <p n="1">1. FIrſt, this Holy Sacrament under viſible ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of bread and wyne ſignifying nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doth inviſibly conteyne the Body and Blood of our Lord which nouriſhes up our ſoules with his grace to life everlaſting Iohn 6. v. 48. <hi>I am the bread of life your Fathers did eate Manna in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and they dyed. This is the bread that deſcendeth from heaven that if any man eate of it he dye not. I am the living bread that came downe from heaven. If any man eate of this bread he shall live for ever.</hi> Behold here the inviſible grace. <hi>And the bread which I will give you is my flesh the life of the world.</hi> Behold the outward viſible ſigne truly conteyning his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who gives the grace. And tell mee not, that it <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59494:52"/> is ſayd of his fleſh. <hi>The flesh profits nothing.</hi> For it is blaſphemy to ſay ſo of his fleſh of which he ſayth here. <hi>My flesh is the life of the world.</hi> A carnall groſſe manner of underſtanding, that his fleſh was, to this effect to be eaten in its owne kind, (like fleſh in the ſhambles,) doth indeed put upon us a ſenſe in which it is true <hi>that his flesh profits nothing.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his fleſh taken (as they tooke it) that is as the fleſh of one who was only man, profit any thing. But theſe his words are <hi>ſpirit and life.</hi> For they ſhould rayſe us in ſpirit to believe this fleſh to be joyned to the divinity, which is ſo able to give his fleſh to be eaten, that, by realy feading upon it they may be nouriſhed to eternall life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here then ſecondly comes in our beliefe of the
<hi>reall preſence</hi> of Chriſt in the Sacrament which we all profeſſe to be his true body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to be bread, but living bread as S. Iohn calls it, whence followeth
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> or change of the ſubſtance of dead bread into the true Body of Chriſt, which we all ſay to be as truly in the Sacrament, as he is in heaven at the right hand of his Father. And therefore adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no leſſe due to him here in the Sacrament, then there in heaven, as reaſon perſwades if we can ſhew that the ſelfe ſame body is really preſent in the Sacrament. Lett the firſt proofe hereof be taken from the cleare, and ſo often repeated words (even word for word) in the Ghoſpel of <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59494:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> S. Matthew, S. Mark, S. Luke, and S. Paul 1. Cor. 11.24. <hi>This is my Body, this is my blood,</hi> and in S. Iohn in the words now cited. If I can ſhew that theſe places be not to be taken figuratively, but litterally, my buiſines is at an end. I think. I can make this evident by this demonſtration.</p>
               <p>If theſe Texts be to be underſtood figuratively (as you Proteſtants ſay) then queſtionleſſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and theyr ſucceſſors did tell the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that it was ſo and to gether with theyr firſt faith, they received that doctrine, and they with that faith delivered it to theyr ſucceſſours. And thus all beleived for ſome time. But then you muſt come to ſome other time in which ſome one man began firſt to teach, that, thoſe texts are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood litterally, as they ſound, and that one man taught that Chriſt was really preſent in the Sacrament and beeing ſo, was alſo to be adored. Now when this one man began this doctrine firſt (for ſome one man muſt have been at firſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner) it could not but ſeeme new, as beeing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard before; it could not but ſeeme ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of falſity, as beeing notoriouſly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contrary to what, all true believers in the world, believed. It could not but be manifeſtly accounted of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding men to be Idolatrous, as teaching that to be adored for God, which all (Inſtructed by the Apoſtles and theyr ſucceſſours) taught to be nothingh elſe but bread and wyne. It could not <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59494:53"/> be accounted a doctrine incredible, which muſt needs teach the great Body of a man to be wholy conteyned in a ſmale quantity of a litle peece of Bread. And which muſt needs teach one, and the ſelf ſame Body, to be really preſent at a thouſand ſeverall places, and to be eaten there, and yet to be ſtill preſent here; which allſo muſt needs teach that there ſhould not be bread and wyne where our own ſences tell us there was nothing elſe but bread and wyne; yea where (as then) faith it ſelf tould them the ſelf ſame. This beeing ſo I ask this vnanſwerable queſtion. How could this one man (who muſt firſt begin to broach this new doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne) be able to ſett it forth ſo plauſibly, that it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a doctrine ſo againſt all reaſon, all ſence, all experience, and all faith of all men (at that time) and allſo a thing ſo hard to perſwade men of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of vnderſtanding for feare of open Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and playne innovation in Religion. So hard to perſwade bad and weake vnderſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, for no kinde of gaine, or benefit, were to be made go directly, not only againſt theyr ancient faith, but to goe flatly againſt theyr own vnderſtanding, and common ſence? How could (I ſay) this one man be able to perſwade this ſtrange, new, vnprofitable, hard doctrine, not to one towne only or Citty, or to one country or nation only, but to the whole multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the riſing of the Sunne, even to the <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59494:53"/> goeing downe thereof? And this ſo that no one is known to have either by word of mouth, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting oppoſed his doctrine, but all to have ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely, and ſo peaceably, and ſo vnanimouſly, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it; that no kind of mention ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in any hiſtory of the leſt ſtop it had, or of the leſt contradiction made any where againſt it, or of the leſt taxing it eyther of Novelty, or of ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea no mention is made in any one country (though there be ſo many countryes in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) when, or where, or by whom, this ſtrange new doctrine was begun. But behold on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine all Chriſtianity (for ſo it was as all learned men know) all Chriſtianity, I ſay, both in the Eaſt and the Weſt both amongſt thoſe who hold with the Roman Church, and thoſe who ſtood in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of it, eyther amongſt the Grecians, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieans, Abiſſins, Aethiopians, all, I ſay again all of them, (who would be called Chriſtians) every where firmely believing, every where profeſſing, and confeſſing the reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d falling on theyr knees to adore him. Is it poſſible that in a point ſo hard as this is, ſo many, ſo differing in cuſtomes, Languages, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Educations, Intereſts, Opinions, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, ſo diſtant from one another in place, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: in dictamens and practices, ſhould all be found at once (and no body can tell at what time firſt) to conſent moſt vnanimouſly? Could ſo <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59494:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> great a thing as this be done upon the perſuaſion of one man, and done ſo ſilently, that no one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle writer ſhould be found to record who that omnipotent man was, or by what meanes he could poſſibly effect a thing ſo incredible all Chriſtianity over, without finding any where, amongſt good or badd, learned or unlearned any conſiderable oppoſition? This ſeems to me a thing ſo incredible, that all, you can ſay againſt our faith in this point, is nothing ſo hard to believe as this alone. Wherefore if this can not be ſo (as ſurely it can not) you muſt all be forced to confeſſe, that when the faith was firſt preached by the Apoſtles, and theyr ſucceſſours, they did not teach your doctrine concerning this Sacrament, but they taught and delivered our doctrine. And then you will ſoone underſtand that all the difficulties here mentioned be eaſy to be anſwered. For hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce you will eaſily vnderſtand how no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of our firſt Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, could be found of this doctrine becauſe ſuch a doctrine (as this is) found ſo univerſally ſpread over all Chriſtendome, and never recorded to have been accounted new, or to have had any particular author or oppoſer, could not poſſibly have had any other beginning; or if it had, had more notice would have be taken of it. But coming in with firſt Chriſtianity you can not wonder to ſee all Chriſtianity found embracing it. And though it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59494:54"/> be a doctrine containing ſo many difficulties, yet beeing propoſed as a part of that Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with all thoſe powerfull motives (which firſt moved all Chriſtians to be Chriſtians) you can not wonder to ſee thoſe, who received Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to receive allſo this Chriſtian belief. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas if they all had, at firſt, received the contrary belief, ſurely at the firſt propoſing of this known novelty, ſome body or other, in ſome one place of Chriſtianity or other, would have opened his mouth and ſayd. <hi>Wee can not adore that for God which the whole torrent of Antiquity, from Chriſt to vs, hath taught to be bread as allſo our ſenſes tells us. Had it been to be adored, the Apoſtles, and thoſe who were taught by them, would have taught us ſo, or at leſt ſome where ſome body or other, would have heard ſome newes of this doctrine before now. But that which You ſay is too new to be true, it is too co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fayth, to all practice, to all reaſon and comon ſenſe.</hi> Can any man imagin that in all Chriſtianity there was neither grace nor witt enough to ſay this. And certinly, at that time the very ſaying of this, muſt needs have quite overthrowne that new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, or at leſt have withdrawne thouſands in all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following of it, with ſo great facility. For, againſt a novelty ſo notorius, and ſo abſurd ſo much would have been ſayd, ſo much would have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo much would have been acted in Councells, either Generall, or Nationall, or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59494:55"/> Provinciall, that ſome ſmale mention of all this would have come to notice of Poſterity, as we ſee things of a thouſand times leſſer concernment have done. Even by your owne bakwardneſs to believe Tranſubſtantiation, and by your great wondering at us for believing it, and by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and great difficulties, which you ſtill object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, you may clearly ſee, how evidently true all that is which I have here ſo fully ſett dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, becauſe it imports ſo much.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lett us go on now, when (Iohn 6.) Chriſt ſayd:
<hi>I am the bread of lyfe</hi> v. 48. and v. 51. <hi>The bread which I will give you is my flesh for the life of the world. The Iewes therefore ſtrove amongſt themſelves ſaying</hi> (as you Proteſtants ſay) <hi>how can this man gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us his flesh to eate? Ieſus therefore ſayd unto them: Amen amen I ſay to you, unleſſe you eate the flesh of the Sonne of Man and drinke his blood you shall not have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe in you. My flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke indeed. Theſe things he ſayd teaching in the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</hi> And he was ſo farre from declaring himſelfe to ſpeake figuratively that by all he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo manifeſtly to meane litterally, that many of his diſciples (and not only ill affected perſons) hearing ſayd, <hi>This ſaying is hard and who can believe it?</hi> And all this happned though, even then, he tould them that <hi>the words he ſpoake to them were ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life.</hi> Becauſe as I ſayd theſe words ought to have rayſed up theyr ſpirits to believe this fleſh <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59494:55"/> of his not to be meere mans fleſh, but to be joyned with the divinity, which was able (by vertue of its omnipotency) to give them his fleſh to eate like bread, and his bloud to drinke like wyne: yet the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re beeing not faith enough for this high point <hi>From that time many even of his diſciples went backe and walked no more with him. v.</hi> 67. That you may evidently ſee how hard this doctrine would have ſounded at firſt broaching of it in the Church if Chriſt had not delivered it, ſeeing that, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, when it came firſt, even <hi>from his mouth</hi> it found ſo ſmale acceptance even amongſt many of his diſciples <hi>Ieſus therefore ſayd to the twelve will you allſo depart? Peter anſwered wee believe and know thou art the ſon of God.</hi> And ſo art able by that thy divinity (to which thy fleſh is joyned) to give vs thy fleſh to eate lyke bread. Now to what end had eyther this been ſayd, or Chriſt (the lover of ſoules) permitted all thoſe <hi>many diſciples to go back</hi> to theyr ruine, and now <hi>to walke no more with him,</hi> to what end this, if he might have ſaved them all by declaring, in a word, that he only intended to give a ſigne, or figure of his body to eate. This one word would have ſaved both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and would allſo have ſaved thoſe millions, and millions which afterwards believed theſe words to be litterally meant, as I expounded them, and S. Peter ſeems to have vnderſtood them, when to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare credible, he ſayd
<hi>we believe and know thou art <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59494:56"/> the Sonne of God.</hi> And conſequently that thou canſt make good thy word, which had been a very eaſy matter, if he only ſpoke of giving his fleſh to be eaten in a meere ſigne or figure of it: had S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thought this I dare ſay he would have pulled the other diſciples backſaying <hi>our maſter only ſpeaks of giving a ſigne of his body.</hi> Had this been ſo, then allſo vndoubtedly the other Evangeliſts, when they had come to write of this myſtery (which had ſcandalized ſo many before theyr writing) would not have encreaſed the ſcandal by writing ſo vnanimouſly of this Sacrament in words ſounding ſo loud a litterall ſenſe as theſe do <hi>This is my body; this is my blood.</hi> But they would rather have leſſned the difficulty by declaring it only to be a figure, which they might have done in a word, S. Paul was ſo farre from declaring it to be ſo that (1. Cor. 11. v. 27.) he flatly ſaith: <hi>Therefore whoſoever shall eate this bread and drink the Chalice of our Lord unworthily he shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> Which could not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he received the Body and Blood truly, and not in a figure only. To eate a Paper picture of Chriſt, makes no ſuch heinous guilt though it be done by a ſinner and it be allſo a figure of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. S. Luke allſo had been particularly to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in encreaſing the ſcandal by expreſſing ſo clearly a litterall ſenſe Chap. 22. v. 19. <hi>This is my <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59494:56"/> body which is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you. This cup is the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my Blood which Chalice shall be shedd for you.</hi> I ſay <hi>which Chalice</hi> that is <hi>that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> ſhall be ſhed for you. Now wine was not ſhed for vs, but his true blood. His true blood therefore was the thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the Chalice. For though by the Latine or Engliſh words, we can not tell whether Chriſt ſayd, his blood ſhould be ſhed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or the Chalice, or Cup, yet S. Luke writing in Greek makes it evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to all (who know that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) that he ſayd the <hi>Chalice should be shed for us</hi> for he ſpeakes in the nominative caſe by a word which can not agree with the blood which in Greek is the dative. Now thus having proved that Chriſt literally ſayd: <hi>This is my body</hi> I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved allſo that <hi>this is not bread. For it is his body</hi> which is as good a conſequence as this,
<hi>this is a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> therefore <hi>it is not bread.</hi> Or, this
<hi>is not bread, for it is a ſtoone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Coming now out of Scripture to anſwer the chiefe okjections I begin with one which doth afford me a new ſtrong argument. They object then Idolatry to vs for adoring that which is bread. I anſwer that according to Scripture Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie can not be found in the only viſible Church of Chriſt for Scripture ſayth clearly of this Church Ifa. 2.18. <hi>And Idolls shall be utterly abolisht.</hi> Again Ezech. 36.25. <hi>And I will power upon you cleane water &amp;c, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> And in <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59494:57"/> the next Chapter v. 23. <hi>Neither shall they defile themſelves any more in theyr Idols.</hi> Again Micheas Chap. 5.12. <hi>Thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands.</hi> Again Zachar. 13. v. 1. <hi>In that day shall be a fountaine lying open to the houſe of David. And it shall be in that day, ſayth the Lord of Hoſts I will caſt of the names of Idols out of the Land, and they shall be remembred no more.</hi> Hence I argue thus. In the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le viſible Church there continued, and doth ſtill continue adoration of the Sacrament, but Idolatry did not continue in the whole Church viſible, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the H. Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not Idolatry. Moreover if worſhipping this H. Sacrament were Idolatry all Chriſtianity (for many ages practizing this adoration) had committed Idolatry, and Chriſts Church (for ſo many ages) had quite fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as is cleare out of the third and fourth point. For Chriſt had no other Church for many ages but that which every where practized this Idolatry as you miſcall it. Or, tel mee if you can, what other viſible Church Chriſt had vpon earth different from the Roman in faith and worſhipe for the thouſand yeares before Luther. If this be the only viſible Church Chriſt had vpon earth, then I have proved it could not be guilty of Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againſt ſuch a torrent of Scripture as we have for vs, you ground yourſelues not in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but in Philoſophy, which, tried by Scripture, will be found to faile you in all your objections. Firſt then you object that an accident can not be <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59494:57"/> without a ſubſtance. Wee anſwere out of Gen. 1.3. <hi>God ſayd be light made, and light was made.</hi> Light is a quality or accident. Yet hence S. Baſil, S. Greg. Naz. and Theodoret are of opinion that light was without any ſubject at all: for the Scripture ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyes no ſubject in which it was put. Whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that at leſt they muſt needs think it poſſible that light ſhould be without a ſubject. Secondly, you object that the ſame body of Chriſt can not be multiplied ſo often over. We anſwere again out of Gen
2.21. <hi>Our Lord God caſt a dead ſleepe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Adam and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was faſt a ſleepe he tooke one of his ribbs and filled up flesh for it. And our Lord God built the ribbe which he tooke of Adam into a woeman.</hi> I aske how many times over muſt this one ribbe be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, before a whole woeman (of a comely proper ſtature) could be made up of it? After the ſame manner God can of one ordinary brick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a pillar of many foote high by multiplying that one brick. In the like manner our Saviour multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed thoſe five <hi>Barley loaves with which he fed abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve five thouſand men.</hi> Io. 6. For if he made new loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves he did not feede them with thoſe five, but with thoſe many hundred new loaves which he made and yet the Scripture ſayth v. 12.13.
<hi>After they were filled they gathered the remnants and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> and not of any new loaves created by Chriſt: ſo that the bread which was eaten remained ſtill
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59494:58"/> to be eaten. And it is worth our noting that our Saviour did this miracle immediatly before he did firſt declare this ſtrange doctrine of giving his fleſh to be eaten like bread by every one, that ſo when he ſhould preſently declare this ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they ſhould have no reaſon to disbelieve the poſſibility thereof. For his diſciples ſeeing, that he had done that moſt prodigious miracle ſo very lately, ought not preſently to have ſayd: <hi>This is hard and who can heare it.</hi> Neither ought they ſo ſoone <hi>to have walked a part from him,</hi> as there S. Iohn ſayth they did but rather they ought to have ſayd with S. Peter <hi>We believe and know thou art the Sonne of God,</hi> able to make they words good <hi>as thou wart able ſo to multiply ſo few loaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence appeares a ſolution of that which allſo they ſtill object: one body can not be in two places at once. For if whole Eve were made of one ribbe of Adam (as the Scripture teſtifieth) ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely the whole ſubſtance of that one ribbe muſt have been in many places or elſe Eve would have been a very litle woeman, or Adam muſt have had very great ribbs. Again our Proteſtants common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read thus Act. 3.21. <hi>Whom the heavens truly muſt conteyne</hi> (we read <hi>Receive) untill the time of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things.</hi> He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they inferr that after Chriſts Aſcenſion the heavens at all times muſt conteyne his body. Therefore (ſay they) after his Aſcenſion his body can not be on earth. This theyr owne <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59494:58"/> Text ſhall refute them thus. The heavens muſt at all times, after his Aſcenſion conteyne his body. But after his Aſcenſion the earth allſo did contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne his body. Therefore his body can be contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in two diſtant places. And, if in two, why not in three, and more? Make the Scripture judge of this point, and it will clearly caſt you, for did not Chriſt, after his Aſcenſion appear in his true body to S. Paul Act. 9. <hi>Who ſayd who art thou Lord, and he, I am Ieſus.</hi> v. 5. And v. 17. Ananias ſayth to him. <hi>The Lord, even Ieſus that appeared, unto thee in the way that thou camſt.</hi> That he appeared in his owne true body I prove by evident Scripture. For, by reaſon of this his apparition, S. Paul numbers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt thoſe who with theyr owne eyes had ſeen Chriſt, riſen again in his true body. For la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to prove Chriſts Reſurrection in a true, and not in a phantaſticall body (as ſome Heretiks will have it) he proves it by eye witneſſes, who all muſt have ſeen Chriſt now riſen in his true body, or elſe theyr teſtimony is vainly brought to prove a true Reſurrection of the fleſh; he then bringing eye wittneſſes, who had ſeen Chriſt now riſen in his true body, makes himſelf as true an eye witt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this as any other. For thus he ſpeakes 1. Cor. 15. v. 4 &amp;c. <hi>He roſe again and was ſeen of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas after that of the eleven. Then he was ſeen of more then five hundred Bretheren together moreover he was ſeen of Iames then of all the Apoſtles. And laſtly of all <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59494:59"/> he was ſeen allſo of me.</hi> To witt in his true body, or elſe all others may be ſayd to have ſeen him in a phantaſticall body, and allſo becauſe any other manner of ſeeing him, had been to no purpoſe to prove the true Reſurrection of dead bodyes which is here his drift. Where ſuppoſing himſelf (by theſe eye wittneſſes) to have proved this he preſently ſayth v. 12. <hi>How do certaine amongſt you ſay that there is no reſurrection of the dead?</hi> Yet agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Act. 22. v. 14. <hi>But he</hi> (Ananias) <hi>ſayd to S. Paul, the God of our fathers had preordeyned thee that thou shouldeſt know his will and ſee that Iuſt one, and heare the voyce of his mouth.</hi> Therefore he appeared in a true body which had <hi>a voyce</hi> and a <hi>mouth</hi> of fleſh. Buth as Chriſt ſayth (Luke 24.39.) <hi>A ſpirit hath no flesh and bones as you ſee me have.</hi> Yet again (Act. 23. v. 10.) S. Paul ſeeth Chriſt on earth for when there was made a great diſſention, the Tribune <hi>fearing leſt Paul should be torne in peeces by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſouldiers to go downe and take him out of the middeſt of them and to bring him into the Caſtle. And the night following the Lord ſtood by him and ſayd: Be conſtant for as thou haſt teſtifyed of me in Ieruſalem ſo muſt thou teſtifie of me at Rome allſo.</hi> Here we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve that very Lord of whom S. Paul did teſtify, <hi>ſtanding by him</hi> in the Caſtle farr diſtant from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by which is evident in how diſtant places Chriſts body may be. To diſprove ſo many cleare Texts give me but on (if you can) that S. Paul <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59494:59"/> did not ſee Chriſt after his Aſcenſion, in his true body vpon our earth; if you can not do this you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re caſt by Scripture in this point which proveth that one body can be at the ſame time in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant places.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly they object that ſo great a body as Chriſts Body is, can not be in ſo ſmale a compaſſe as a litle bitt of bread. We ſtill anſwere out of Scripture. <hi>Firſt</hi> Matthew 19, v.
26. where ſpeach is of making the great body of a Camel paſſe through a needles eye, Chriſt ſayth: <hi>with men this is impoſsible.</hi> Where note that Chriſt here (according to three Evangeliſtes) ſpeaks of ſuch a paſſage through a needles eye, as is <hi>in poſsible with men;</hi> ſo that, though with men there is no ſuch thing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as penetration of ſeverall parts of the ſame great Camels body, brought into ſo ſmale a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe as is a needles eye, yet not ſo with God.
<hi>With God all things are poſsible.</hi> Secondly God can put two different bodyes ſo, as to take vp only the place of one body; therefore he can put al the parts of one body ſo, as to take up only the rome of the leſt part, with which he can penetrate al the reſt. Thus Iohn 20. v. 19. <hi>When the doores were shutt, where the diſciples were gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>red together, for feare of the Iewes, Ieſus came and ſtood in the midle.</hi> So that, as, at his birth, his body penetrated through his Mothers wombe, at his Reſurrection, through the great ſtone of his monument and as, at his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59494:60"/> he did not make a hole through the body of the heavens, but his body was penetrated with thoſe heavenly bodyes, ſo here it penetrated through the ſhutt doore, or wall; and ſo two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes were in one place at once; by which allſo we prove that one body may as eaſily, by his power, be in two places at once. Wherefore it is to you (who againſt Scripture thus ſtand ſtill alleadging Philoſophy) that we muſt ſay with S. Paul Col. 2.8. <hi>Beware leaſt any man deceive you by Philoſophy and vaine fallacie according to the Tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Chriſt,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom you cite Ariſtotle.</p>

                  <hi>THE XIII. POINT.</hi> Of Communion under one kind.</head>
               <p>PRoteſtants complaine we take half of the Sacrament from them. We complaine they have taken five Sacraments from us, and grace from all ſeven. And as for this Sacrament they have taken both the body and blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from it, and left only bread and wyne. If we had taken wyne away, no great hurt, wyne beeing nothing but wyne. To the purpoſe we have a full compleate and perfect Sacrament when we have ſuch an outward ſigne as ſignifyeth, and contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth inviſible grace. The conſecrated bread alone
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59494:60"/> doth this; in this therefore we have a full, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, and perfect Sacrament. Chriſt ſpeaks this clearely Io. 6. v. 48. <hi>I am the bread of lyfe your fathers did eate manna in the deſert and they dyed. This is the bread that deſcendeth from heaven that if any man ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of it he dye not. I am the lyving bread that came downe from heaven. If any man eate of this bread he shall live for ever.</hi> Behold as full an effect of the Sacrament as is any where promiſed to both kinds. And he beeing living bread you have all him in it, and ſo you are deprived of nothing. He gave us his body, not his Carcaſſe without blood. In his body we have all, both body, and blood. You take both from us: we give both. Agreable to this ſayth S. Paul, 1. Cor. 11.27. <hi>Therefore whoſoever shall eate this bread, or drink this Chalice of our Lord unworthyly, he is guilty of the body and blood of our Lord,</hi> which he could not be, if he did not receive both <hi>body, and blood;</hi> ſo that by either <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> both are received. Againe Luke 24. v. 30. <hi>And it came to paſſe whyle he ſat at table with them</hi> (the two diſciples in Emaus) <hi>he tooke bread, and bleſſed, and brake, and did reach to them.</hi> Twice Chriſt, with his owne hands, gave the Communion. Firſt at the laſt ſupper under both kinds. Secondly here at Emmaus under one kind only. For many Holy Fathers (without ever ſcrupulizing at the giving only one kind) abſolutely ſay Chriſt here gave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the Text inſinuates as much,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59494:61"/> by the uſe of thoſe Sacramentall words, of
<hi>taking, bleſsing, breaking, reaching,</hi> with the enſuing effect of
<hi>opening theyr eyes to know him</hi> to be the ſame Chriſt, who, at his laſt ſupper, had done the ſame action. So that it is the more probable that he did adminiſter Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under one kind, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he did not. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare you abſolutely condemne this? They object <hi>drinke ye all of this</hi> Matth. 26. But this command was only given to all then preſent, and was fullfilled. <hi>And they all dranke of it.</hi> Mark 14.23. So when he commanded <hi>do this.</hi> He did not commaund Lay men to do what he did. Theyr other objections are excellently anſwered by the Scriptures alledged in the Councel of Trent Seſſ. 21. c. 1. in theſe notable words he that ſayd <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you eate the flesh of the Son of man, and drinke his blood you shall not have life in you</hi> hath allſo ſayd: <hi>If any one eat of this bread he shall life for ever.</hi> And he that ſayd: <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath life everlaſting,</hi> hath allſo ſayd: <hi>The bread which I will give you is my flesh for the life of the world,</hi> he that ſayd: <hi>Who ſo eateth my flesb and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> hath likwiſe ſayd: <hi>He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.</hi> What need wee more then to live for ever.</p>

                  <hi>THE XIV. POINT.</hi> Of the Maſſe, or of the Holy Euchariſt as it is a Sacrifice.</head>
               <p n="1">1. CHriſt in his laſt ſupper ſayd Luke 22.19.
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> We muſt ſee then what Chriſt did, that we may know what is commanded here to be done. If he did offer his Body and Blood then in Sacrifice, the Church allſo is bound to have ſome Miniſters <hi>doing that in remembrance of him.</hi> We ſay then that Chriſt did then offer his body, and blood in Sacrifice and we ſay that the doeing this, is the very eſſence of our Maſſe. I know, as ſoone as Proteſtants heare the word <hi>Remembrance,</hi> they will object that Chriſt can not be really offered there where the offering is done to his Remembrance. I anſwere that S. Paul tells us what it is to do this in Remembrance of Chriſt. 1. Cor. 11.24.26. <hi>This do ye in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me, for as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the Chalice you shall shew the death of our Lord untill he come.</hi> Chriſt here is remembred by us to have dyed for us, yet he doth not here really dye againe bloodily, but this unbloudy Sacrifice is done in remembrance of his real bloudy death. It is not only in <hi>Remembrance of him that we do <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59494:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> this, but we do this in Remembrance of him, dying for us a bloody death upon the Croſſe.</hi> Now his beeing truly preſent maketh the
<hi>Remembrance</hi> not leſſe but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re lively and perfect. For if a Prince, who had gained a great battel, with much loſſe of his blood would have yearely ſome action, or repreſentation exhibited in remembrance of it, would in perſon be preſent with his wounds, acting his owne part, the repreſentation would not ceaſe to be a <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> but it would rather be a far more lively <hi>Remembrance</hi> as often as the king ſhould act his owne part. And the yeare he ſhould not do this, the Remembrance would be leſſe lively and leſſe repreſentative: ſo &amp;c. How perfectly in this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is Chriſts death repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted whileſt by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of theſe words <hi>This is my body,</hi> only his body is put in ſhape of bread in one place wholy different from that other place, in which, by force of thoſe words <hi>This is my blood,</hi> his blood, in a liquide ſhape of wine, like blood lately ſhed, is put in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice a part from his body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now I will ſhew that Chriſt did truly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and offer up his body, and blood under the formes of bread and wyne. Firſt out of the old Teſtament Pſal. 100. v. 5. it is ſayd of Chriſt. <hi>Our Lord ſwore, and it shall not repent him, thou art a Prieſt for ever of the order of Melchiſedech,</hi> which words S. Paul 5. Heb. 10. ſayth to have bin ſpoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Chriſt, and of this is Prieſthood. <hi>We have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59494:62"/> great ſpeach</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and inexplicable to utter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are weake to heare.</hi> You muſt looke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a myſtery, not eaſily underſtood by new Chriſtians. The famous Prieſthood in the old Law was ſettled in Aaron, and his Sonns (Levit. 8.) they offered bloody Sacrifices, and yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is not ſayd a Prieſt according to the order of Aaron but of Melchiſedech, who was not ſo much as a Iew. <hi>He whoſe deſcent is not counted from them, took tythe of Abraham and bleſſed him, that had the promiſſes.</hi> (Heb. 7.6.) which ſheweth he was a Prieſt of higher dignity then Abraham as S. Paul here proves. Lett us ſee now all that the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſayth of Melchiſedech, and his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and you ſhal find it to be only that which is written Geneſis c. 14.18. <hi>But Melchiſedech King of Salem bringeth forth bread, and wyne. And he was the Prieſt of the moſt high God. And he bleſſed him (Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) and he gave him tythes of all.</hi> So unanimous is the conſent of all the H. Fathers (who did write either upon this text of Geneſis, or on that of S. Paul, or that of the Pſalme) that the Prieſthood of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech did conſiſt in offering bread, and wyne, by way of Sacrifice to God, and that Chriſts bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prieſt, according to his order, did conſiſt in his offering up, and ſacrificing his body, and his blood for us, under the formes of bread, and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that to deny this, is to croſſe all antiquity, ſee the Rhemiſts upon theſe two laſt Texts. Now <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59494:63"/> becaufe Chriſt, to the end of the world, offereth ſtill this ſacrifice by his Vicars, or Miniſters hands in the Sacrifice of the Maſſe. He is ſayd <hi>to be a Prieſt for ever according to the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> For by force of theſe words
<hi>This is my body,</hi> his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is put under the ſpecies of bread, and then in a place a part from that body of his, he, by force of theſe words
<hi>This is my blood,</hi> doth put his blood in the Chalice under the ſhape of wyne like blood poured forth and ſepared from the body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again Ieremy 33. v. 18. <hi>There shall not faile of David a man to fitt upon the throne of the houſe of Iſraël. And of the Prieſts and Levits there shall not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le from before my face a man to offer offerings, and to kindle meat offerings and to do ſacrifice continually.</hi> By ſuch ſacrifices as then were known God expreſſed the continuance of true ſacrifice in his Church there muſt not then fayle now Prieſts and Levits offering a true ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now God ſpeaks thus expreſly to the Prieſts of the old Law <hi>I have no will in you ſayth the Lord of Hoſtes and an offering I will not receive of your hands.</hi> Malachy 1. v. 10. So that the former Text muſt needs be underſtood of Prieſts offering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Sacrifices in the new Teſtament. But now a cleane Sacrifice, not a bloody one therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re here in the next verſe it followeth, <hi>for from the riſing of the Sunne, even to the going down, great is my name among the Gentles. And in every place incenſe <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59494:63"/> shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering</hi> to wit the pure offering and cleane Oblation of Chriſts body, under the ſweet, and lovely ſhape of bread and wyne into which all thoſe Holocauſts, burnt-offerings, and killing of Victimes, were turned, though Ieremy uſed theſe termes, becauſe they, as then, knew no other ſacrifices, as they knew no other <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Levits,</hi> but ſuch as were killers of Victimes in a bloody manner. But it is very obſervable that the ſame Prophet Malachy ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the third chapter of the coming of the Meſſias (and <hi>the Lord whom ye ſeek</hi> v. 1.) doth all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tell us clearly this, <hi>then shall the offerings of Iuda, and Ieruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord v.</hi> 4. although before he had ſo flatly ſayd to the Prieſts of Iuda and Ieruſalem <hi>I have no will in you and offerings I will not receive at your hands.</hi> Whence it is evident that by the <hi>pleaſing Sacrifice of Iuda and Ieruſalem,</hi> he meaneth not the carnall, but the ſpirituall <hi>Iuda and Ieruſalem,</hi> that is Chriſts Church, where ſacrifice is to be done continually as we did now ſay out of Ieremy.</p>

In the very laſt yeares of the world Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, knowing the chiefe worſhip of God to conſiſt in this Sacrifice, ſhall ſo mightily labour to aboliſh it, that he ſhall ſeem (for a very ſhort time) to have prevailed. Daniel 9.27. <hi>And in the half of the weeke shall the Hoſt and the Sacrifice faile and there shall be in the Temple abomination of deſolation</hi> which <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59494:64"/> laſt words our Saviour himſelf expoundeth to be underſtood of the end of the world Matth.
24. <hi>What ſigne of thy coming and of the Conſummation of the world?</hi> Sayd the Apoſtles to him v. 3. Our Lord telling many other ſignes at laſt ſayth v. 14. <hi>This Ghoſpel shall be preached in the whole world and then shall come the Conſummation thereof, therefore when you shall shee the abomination of deſolation which is ſpoken of by Daniel the Prophet &amp;c.</hi> This then ſhall not happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> untill the world is eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to the end and the Ghoſpel ſhall have been preached every where.</p>
               <p n="6">6. According therefore to the practice of the Law of nature in time of Melchiſedech and according to the practice, and manifeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in the written law, exteriour Sacrifice (which from the beginning of the world was ever held the chief, and peculiar worſhip due to God) is allſo to be found in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>from the riſing of the Sunne to the going down,</hi> even till the worlds end, when Anti-chriſt, for a ſhort time, ſhall in great part aboliſh it. Lett us then ſee the Sacrifice that Chriſt (a Prieſt for ever according to the order of Melchiſedech) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in his Church Luke 22. v. 19. <hi>This is my body which is given for you.</hi> Now given in this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and now, by me, offered in an vnbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy manner; he ſayth not <hi>to you</hi> but
<hi>for you,</hi> that is for your ſins, which body preſently after I wil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in a bloody Sacrifice upon the Croſſe. Behold here a Sacrifice, and a propitiatory Sacrifice: For <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59494:64"/> what is offered <hi>for us,</hi> and offered <hi>for remiſsion of ſins,</hi> is a propitiatory offering, applying plentifully the ſatisfaction of Chriſts Paſſion to us, not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from that Sacrifice, but deriving the fruits thereof to us. Thus his body is properly ſayd <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us.</hi> But when it is given in the Sacrament, it is ſayd given <hi>to us,</hi> not <hi>for us.</hi> This Sacrifice the Apoſtles were offering to our Lord Act. 13.2. when they are ſayd to have been <hi>miniſtring to our Lord.</hi> Had they been miniſtring the word of God, or miniſtring the Sacrament, they had miniſtred <hi>to the people.</hi> But they had not been <hi>miniſtring to our Lord,</hi> that is offering ſome thing to him. In the Greeke text it is
<hi>they beeing offering Sacrifice to our Lord.</hi> And ſo Eraſmus tranſlats it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Sacrifice is plainly inſinuated in S. Paul 1, Cor. 10. if his diſcourſe be well noted. He there, diſcourſing of the Iewiſh and Heathniſh Sacrifice doth conclude, that all ſuch perſons as will be partakers of theſe Sacrifices, can not be made partakers of the Chriſtian Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of our Saviour. Firſt then v. 14. he bids them, <hi>fly from ſerving Idols<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by eyther Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to them, or eating of that which hath been Sacrificed to them. If they will doe this, he tells them of a farr better Sacrifice, of which they may be made partakers at our Altars For ſayth he v. 16. <hi>The Chalice of benediction which we do bleſs, is it not the Communication of the Blood of Chriſt? And the<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59494:65"/> bread which we break is it not the partieipation of the Body of our Lord?</hi> And having thus taught them, that, by vertue of the Prieſts Benediction, or Conſecration, the true Body, and Blood of Chriſt, are made communicable upon our Altars, under the ſhapes of bread, and wyne he goeth on to tell them, they can not be partakers of this Sacrifice, if they will continue ſtill to partake of eyther Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh, or Heathniſh Sacrifices, of which they truly make themſelves partakers if they will ſtill eat of that which is ſacrificed by them. <hi>For behould Iſraël</hi> (ſayth he v. 18) <hi>they that eat of the ſacrificed Hoſts are they not partakers of the Altar?</hi> For by thus doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they communicate with thoſe that Sacrifice. And having thus ſpoake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewiſh Sacrifices, he ſpeaks to them of the Gentills Sacrifices. <hi>But the things which Heathens do Sacrifice, to Divels they Sacrifice, and not to God, And I will not have you have fellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>you can not be partakers of the Table of our Lord, and of the Table of the Divels.</hi> The reaſon why we cite and expound this place ſo fully is, becauſe we deſire exceedingly to have it noted how that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <hi>our Chalice, our Bread, our Table, and Altar, the participation of our Hoſt, and Oblation,</hi> are, point by point, in all Conditions, effects and proprieties, compared to the Altar, Hoſts, Sacrifices, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blations <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59494:65"/> of the Iewes, and Gentills and, as he calls theyr Chalice the <hi>Chalice of the Divels,</hi> for no other reaſon but becauſe it conteyns liquor Sacrificed to him, ſo he muſt be ſayd to call <hi>our Chalice</hi> the <hi>Chalice of our Lord</hi> becauſe it conteyns the liquor of Chriſts blood ſacrificed <hi>to our Lord.</hi> For by force of theſe words <hi>This is my blood,</hi> his blood under a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ſpecies is put in the Chalice as it were a part from that body which before he had put under the ſhape of bread. All which diſcourſe had been very ineffectuall if this had not bin the proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice among the Chriſtians as thoſe others were the knowne Sacrifices of the Iewes and Gentills.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Again the ſame S. Paul ſayth Heb. 13. v. 10. <hi>We have an Altar of which they have no right to eat who ſerve the Tabernacle</hi> ſtill preſſing the Iewes, that they can not partake of the Sacrifice of our <hi>Altar,</hi> if they will ſtill ſtick faſt to theyr old Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. And note, that, which he called before <hi>the Table of our Lord,</hi> he now calleth an <hi>Altar</hi> truly and properly ordeyned for Sacrifice and ſo he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes it <hi>thyſiaſtirion</hi> that is
<hi>Sacrificatorium. An Altar to Sacrifice upon.</hi> And by that word allwaies the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of the Iewes (ordeyned for Sacrifice) are ſtill out of the Hebrew interpreted in Greek. Well the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>we have an Altar</hi> built purpoſely to offer Sacrifice upon, therefore we have a true Sacrifice, not of bread and wyne (for in no mans opinion we Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice theſe) but of the Body, and Blood of our <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59494:66"/> Saviour, under the ſhape of bread and wyne. And this was the reaſon why in the Primative Church the Heathens would ſome times ſay we worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Bacchus</hi> the God of wyne, and
<hi>Ceres</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of corne: ſometimes they traduced us as
<hi>feeders on mans flesh,</hi> for eating the fleſh of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I conclude that had not this manner of Sacrificing in the Maſſe been delivered us with our firſt faith from the Apoſtles, it could never (without notice beeing taken of the firſt authour, and of the time &amp;c.) have been univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved with out oppoſition of any, or without beeing ever taxed by any one of Novelty, yea and be received allſo ſo univerſally that, if before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers days, you look into all Pariſhes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (where Confeſſed Heretiks did not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere) you will, in every Pariſh thereof, find no other Common ſervice uſed publikly in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but the ſaying and celebrating Maſſe, with offering that which they all adored for the true Body and Blood of Chriſt under the ſhape of bread and wyne. A Proofe unanſwerable. See what we ſayd before Point 12. n. 2.</p>

                  <hi>THE XV. POINT.</hi> Of ſaying Maſſes and other publike prayers in the Latin tongue.</head>
               <p n="1">1. INS. Matth. Chap. 1. v. 17. <hi>All the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Tranſmigration of Babylon unto Chriſt fourteen generations,</hi> a very long time. And yet all this time the Iewiſh Church (the only true Church in the world) had all her Scriptures and all her publike ſervice, and prayer (which was all taken out of the Pſalmes, the Law, and the Prophets) in that very language in which they were written, to witt, in old Hebrew: that is, in a language wel known indeed to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes before theyr Tranſmigration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babylon, but in theyr Captivity at Babylon, they loſt the knowledge of theyr old Hebrew lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (in which all theyr Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) and did not perfectly learne the Chaldean, or Babylonian language, whence they made a mixture of both thoſe languages, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Syrike language. The very letters, and characters of this language differ as much as the Greek letters differs from the Latin. So that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, who can perfectly read the one, can not ſo much as read the other. Neither do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59494:67"/> one another more, then the Italians can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Latin, which was theyr ancient native tongue. The Scriptures were not at this time (but ſome good time after Chriſt) tranſlated in to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike as your great Doctours (who now at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow have ſett forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your famous Bible of ſo many languages) do profeſſe in theyr Praeface to theyr Bible. And by the way, they allſo (in the ſame Praeface) plainly and openly confeſſe that in no Pariſh in Chriſtendom they could in any of thoſe nations (which they have cauſed to be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for old copies) find, ſo much as one ancient ſervice booke written in a language underſtood by the vulgar or common people of the place. A teſtimony to theyr owne condemnation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The knowledge then of the old Hebrew tongue, in which all the Scriptures were written, beeing ſo much loſt in the Captivity of Babilon, they had all theyr Scriptures and publike ſervice (which was taken out of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Pſalmes) read in a language unknown to all the common people and this was done <hi>for fourteen generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence preſently after theyr Captivity, when they firſt retourned into theyr country Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra was forced by himſelf and others to make the Law be interpreted unto them Nehemiah c. 8. v. 8. v. 13. So when our Saviour upon the Croſſe did, in the old Hebrew words of the Pſalme, ſay as it <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59494:67"/> was firſt written <hi>Eli Eli Lammaſabachihani</hi> Mat. 27. v. 46. S. Matthew, who did write his Ghoſpel in that new kind of Hebrew or Syrike (which was vulgarly ſpoaken by the Iewes in Chriſts dayes) is forced to interprete theſe words ſaying <hi>which is interpreted my God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> For this reaſon allſo he interpreted ſeverall other Hebrew words. A manifeſt ſigne they could not be underſtood by the Iewes (in whoſe language he did write) without interpretation. And as he who writes Engliſh, ſhould ridiculouſly interpret Engliſh, ſo if thoſe words of the Pſalme had been written by David in the ſame language in which S. Matthew did write, it had been ridiculous for him to adde theyr interpretation. Ioſephus the Iew tells you what a world of ſchooles there were in Ieruſalem for Children to learne the Law and Prophets, they beeing written in a language other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unknown. Well then, as thoſe who have not been now at our Latin Schooles underſtand not our Latin Bible and ſervice; ſo then, the vulgar ſort underſtood not theyr Scriptures, nor theyr common ſervice taken out of them, and read in theyr Synagogues before theyr Sermons, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, which S. Paul calls
<hi>The leſſon of the Law and Prophets.</hi> Act. 13.5. Neither after the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did the vulgar underſtand the words <hi>of Moyſes, who of old times hath in every citty thoſe who preach him in the Synagogue where he is read every Sabboth.</hi> 
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59494:68"/> Act. c. 15. v. 21. <hi>Read</hi> I ſay but not (as then) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the vulgar. This practice was prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before the eyes of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and they never did the leſt reprehend it, or give order to have the Bible turned into the Syriak language that the vulgar might underſtand it. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we be blamed for uſing either Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or divine Service in a language not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the people?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly I ask what you ſay to that place of Leviticus c. 16. v. 17. <hi>Lett no man be in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle when the high Prieſt goeth into the Sanctuary to pray for himſelf and his houſe and for the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Iſraël untill he come forth:</hi> See you not here publik prayer made expreſly <hi>for the whole aſſembly,</hi> and yet no one of the aſſembly permitted to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or ſee, what there was done by the Prieſt, to God for them, even then, when the Prieſt made an attonement for himſelf, for his houſehold and for all the congregation of Iſraël. Again Luk. 1.10. <hi>All the multitude of the people was praying without at the Houre of incenſe.</hi> The Prieſt was doing his duty with in (where he could neither be ſeen nor heard by the people without) yet they aſſiſting at the Prieſts function, done for them, were not leſſe partakers of the benefit thereof, though they could neither, ſee him, nor heare him: ſo prayer, made and offered up for the people, in a low voyce, or in an unknown language, is available to them <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59494:68"/> who know not the particular meaning of the words ſayd for them. It is ſufficient then they know they conteyne a particular prayſe of God, and a ſpeciall worſhip of him, and a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending of our neceſſities unto him. And that they be, as moſt pious prayers approved by the Church, and recommended by all the learned men hereof who very well underſtand them. Now a petition well made, even when its preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Petitioner, who underſtands not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which the petition is made, obteynes of the King, or Emperour (who underſtand it) as much, as if the Petitioner had perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood every word of it. When the Children (Mat. 21.16.) cryed in the Temple <hi>Oſanna to the Sonne of David</hi> though they knew not what they ſayd, yet Chriſt called it a <hi>perfect prayſe</hi> ſaying
<hi>that out of the mouth of Infants and ſucklings thou haſt perfected pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</hi> A rich Iewell in the hands of an Infant, or Clowne, who knows not to penetrate the valew of it, doth not, for that cauſe, ceaſe to be truly of as great valew, as when it is in the hands of a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weller. So Latin prayers in the mouthes of the vulgar, be as pretious in the ſight of God. (When they be ſayd with equall devotion) as when they are in the mouthes of great ſchollers. You who, ſcorned to uſe Latin ſervice, ſoone came to ſee your Engliſh ſervice with all ſcornfull contempt ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſhed out of almoſt all your Church. And your <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59494:69"/> people did ſoone grow to lyke no ſervice at all ſince they miſlyked the Latin ſervice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will now examine our adverſaries chief ground in Scripture which is out of the firſt of the Corinthians Ch. 14. Where I would have the Reader to note that untill 14. verſe, S. Paul only ſpeaks of uſing an unknown language in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching exhorting, interpreting, and teaching, in all which exerciſes we ſtill uſe the vulgar tongue: ſo that hetherto he hath nothing againſt us. From the 14. verſe he begins indeed to ſpeak of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not of publike divine ſervice, but of ſuch extemporall prayer as is made before all, that all may joyn with it, and he ſpeaks there, not of the uſe of any ſett forme of prayer, practiced by the Church (as the Liturgie is) but he manifeſtly ſpeaks only againſt the uſe of an unknown, and Barbarous tongue in the making of ſuch Hymnes, and Canticles, and Prayers, as many then did uſe to make by divine inſpiration in the preſence of the whole Congregation to edify the Bretheren aſſembled; and to excite them to love, to honour and prayſe God; not intending chiefly to pray to God for the people, as we do in our Liturgie, of which kind of ſett forme of prayer S. Paul can not be ſayd to ſpeak. For it is apparent, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Corinthians (to whom he writ) there was no uſe at all of an unknown, or Barbarous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the Liturgie, or divine ſervice; wherefore <pb n="125" facs="tcp:59494:69"/> of this S. Paul could not complaine, for theyr Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie was undoubtedly in Greek, which was the known language among them; and in which he did write this very Epiſtle to them. Allſo in which they had theyr ſet formes of prayer. Now then S. Paul ſpeaketh not at all againſt the uſe of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue in eyther the Liturgie or in any other uſuall ſett forme of publik prayer, for there was no abuſe at all in that kind, but he only ſpeaks againſt that uſe, practiced by ſome in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporall Canticles, Prayers and Hymnes (which then divers uſed) yet of ſuch kind of prayers allſo (though made in unknown and Barbarous ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues (he ſayth v. 14. <hi>If I pray in an unknown ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue my ſpirit prayeth</hi> and this great good I have by my prayer <hi>but my underſtanding is without fruict:</hi> that is without the fruict of inſtruction or edifying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. A fruict which ought to be ſought for by thoſe, to whom God had ſo particularly given that miraculous guift of ſpeaking in ſeverall ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, purpoſely that they might excyte, and ſtyrre up the people of ſeverall tongues and nations to the knowledge, prayſe, honour and love of God; and therefore he addeth <hi>I will pray in ſpiritt, I will pray allſo in underſtanding,</hi> that in thoſe prayers I may not deprive the ſtanders by of that fruict. But you muſt know that neither the Maſſe nor the ſett formes of prayer in our Liturgie, be ordeyned for this end of inſtructing others. Becauſe for this <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59494:70"/> we have other exerciſes of Catechiſing, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, exhorting, preaching &amp;c. But chiefly thoſe prayers be appointed to the Prieſt (who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them) to offer them up to God for the people. The Epiſtles and Ghoſpels, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne inſtructions) be interpreted and largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto the people in our Churches upon thoſe dayes on which they are bound to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and to reſort to Maſſe. The other chiefe parts of the maſſe be, in all Maſſes, the ſelfſame. And beeing ſo often uſed (and therefore upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſo often declared to the people) they muſt indeed be very <hi>Idiots</hi> if they know not when ſo ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> when to kneele, to adore, to knock theyr breaſts, when to ryſe, when to ſtand, or to do any thing elſe that concerns them or is proper for them to do. Therefore it can not be ſayd againſt our Maſſe, which you uſe to object out of v. 16. <hi>Elſe when thou shalt bleſſe with the ſpiritt how shall he that occupieth the roome of the unlearned ſay Amen, at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtands not what thou ſayſt.</hi> This (as I ſayd) can not be ſayd of our ſo well known ſet forme of prayer and ſervice which we all knowing to be approved by the Church, and to be underſtood, and ſo highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed by our learnedſt men, feare not to ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> or to joyn our intention with any part of it; neither doth its approbation depend on our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I anſwer therefore that S. Paul ſpoak of <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59494:70"/> thoſe exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral bleſſings, Canticles and Lauds, or ſuch lyke inſpired prayers of private perſons, which he recommends to be ſayd in the vulgar language, yet the contrary is not ill though it be leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For even to him who doth the contrary it is ſayd v. 17. <hi>Thou verily giveſt thanks well</hi> and not fooliſhly or ſuperſtitiouſly. <hi>But the other is not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> which fruict, and end thou ſhouldeſt chiefly have intended, God having to this end given thee this guift. And therefore in ſuch exerciſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion <hi>I will ſpeake five words with my underſtanding rather then tenne thouſand words in a tongue,</hi> that is a barbarous tongue, ſtraunge to the Heares, becauſe the chief end of theſe exerciſes is to edify, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the people to prayſe God; whereas the chief end of the Liturgie is to pray to God for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I allſo note that S. Paul doth not ſo much as meane here to exclude the uſe of ſuch well known tongues as the Greek and Latin were, that is ſuch as were the languages well known to all the better bred ſort of moſt nations; ſo that here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Maſſe ſayd in Latin through the Latin Churches, or in all thoſe weſterne parts where all knowing and underſtanding men, very commonly know this language. I prove this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly. For if S. Paul ſhould call this praying in a tongue (your Bible puts in a different letter the word <hi>unknown</hi>) ſo as to make ſuch a tongue as <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59494:71"/> this, unfit for publike ſervice in theſe Countries, he himſelf had notably tranſgreſſed in this matter, who beeing to write to the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, writes to them in Greek, knowing well that they ſpoak Latin, only, and that the vulgar knew no other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. Yet he did thus write to them a very large E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle in Greek now divided into ſixteen Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this though he did write this chieffly for theyr inſtruction and edification. Behold this was done even by him, who ſayd before <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak five words with my underſtanding that my voyce might teach others then tenne thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> You muſt not then call ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in <hi>an unknown tongue,</hi> the ſpeaking in ſuch languages as are well known to the learneder ſort of thoſe people, to whom you ſpeak. Wherefore you muſt not ſay he did ſpeak in a tongue, or <hi>an unknown tongue</hi> to the Romans when he did write in the Greek tongue to them, though he was not underſtood by the vulgar of them, but only by the learneder ſort: Now then, as he can not be ſayd to have ſpoaken in an unknow tongue to the Romans, when he did write this Epiſtle to them in Greek, becauſe Greek is not a Barbarous ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, wholy <hi>unknown</hi> to the better ſort: ſo a Roman Prieſt, ſaying Maſſe in Latin in the weſterne parts, doth not ſay Maſſe <hi>or ſpeak in a tongue</hi> that is a tongue wholy unknown to the better ſort. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore as the Greek tongue was not judged a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59494:71"/> unfit for S. Paul writing to the Romans, even when theyr inſtruction was chiefly to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſo it is not unfitt, when not inſtruction, but making prayer for the people to God, is chiefly intended, as in the Maſſe. Read the Remiſh Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment handling this Chapter very well.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And obſerve allſo that the ſervice of the Catholik or univerſall Church, is beſt celebrated by a Catholik or univerſal tongue ſuch as Greek is in the Eaſt; Latin in the Weſt; tongues, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch alterations, and peril of changes, in ſubſtantiall words, as vulgar languages are; and therefore leſſe fitt for the everlaſting perpetuity and univerſality of the Church. If at our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we had had our Maſſe in the old Brittiſh, or old Engliſh language, who would now have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it. Yea who doth not laugh at all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh he reads, which is much above a hundred yeares ſtanding. It was moſt unfitt, the Liturgie ſhould be ſo often chopped, and changed as vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar languages alter. Or that it ſhould uſualy be ſo often turned into ſeverall tongues, not underſtood by the Church Repreſentative. So that ſhe could not paſſe her Iudgement, whether there were any groſſe corruptions creapt into this moſt divine ſervice. Therefore in reſpect of univerſality, both of all ages (for which the Church was to laſt) and of univerſality of all nations (through which ſhee was to be ſpread) no language more fitt, for her <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59494:72"/> publik, conſtant ſervice, then Hebrew, Greek and Latin. God regarded unity in worſhip, ſo much that he would have the whole nation of the Iewes (for a thouſand and ſix hundred yeares) only to Sacrifice in one place, though it might be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that this much hindred the many, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sacrifices which would otherwiſe have been offered if in any place they might Sacrifice. To keepe unity in Religion it is moſt rationally ordered that Sacrifice ſhould be celebrated with prayers in one, and the ſame language over one and the ſame Church. Moreover it is well known that a diſtance, from what is ordinary, and vulgar, breeds reſpect and reverence. And contrarywiſe you your ſelves found, that publike ſervice in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh was ſoone vilifyed and contemned by the vulgar Engliſh, and at laſt, with all expreſſions of contempt, and diriſion, quite exploded, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.

                  <hi>THE XVI. POINT.</hi> Of the Sacrament of Pennance or Confeſsion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. EVen in the old Law ſome particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of particular ſins was under precept appointed to the Iewes Numb. 5.6.
<hi>Speak to the Children of Iſrael; man or woeman when they shall doe any of all the ſins that are wont to chance to men and by negligence have tranſgreſſed the Commandment of theyr Lord, and have offended, they shall confeſſe theyr ſin. And</hi> (if theyr ſin were in point of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging theyr neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) <hi>they shall reſtore the principall it ſelf and the fift part over to him againſt whom they ſinned.</hi> Behold Confeſſion, behold Reſtitution, and for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>the fift part</hi> over and above to be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And, beſides that, ſacrifice to be offered to God, ſo to repaire the diſhonor done him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The new Law, perfecting the old, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was elevated by Chriſt to a Sacrament, giving grace Io. 20. v. 23. <hi>He ſayd to them receave the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt whoſe ſins you forgive they are forgiven, and whoſe ſins you retaine they are retained. But Thomas was not with them, when Ieſus came;</hi> yet no man can deny that this power was allſo give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Thomas. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce appeares that it was not give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only to thoſe who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59494:73"/> then were preſent, as a grant give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meerly for theyr ſakes and to encreaſe theyr authority, but this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſake of all belonging to Chriſts flock, of which flock the farre greater number li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the times of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this text is litterally to be underſtood (as I have interpreted it) may be demonſtratively prooved by the ſame argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by which we proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Text, <hi>This is my body,</hi> to be litterally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. P. 12. n. 2. For if the Apoſtles, with the firſt faith, did not deliver this litterall ſenſe, but only taughr this power to end with them, and that no man, after theyr dayes, either had power to forgive ſins, or ſtood obliged to confeſſe them, then you muſt ſay that, in ſome after age, ſome one man began firſt (for allwaies one begins at firſt) to vent a broad theſe two ſtraunge things, firſt <hi>that all Prieſts had power to forgive ſins.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that all Chriſtians, guilty of ſin, were bound under paine of damnation to confeſſe theyr ſins to the Prieſts,</hi> though they were never ſo foul, or never ſo ſecret. But ſhall any one man make me believe, that this ſingle mans doctrine ſo new, and ſo hard, could preſently, without contradiction, grow to be ſo generally received and practized not in one, but in all parts of Catholike Chriſtianity? And that no hiſtory ſhould tell us who this man was? where, or when he broached this doctrine? Or how he could ſo bewitch all that no man ſhould contradict him, <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59494:73"/> or that no one ſhould have grace or witt to ſay: <hi>If Prieſts had this power, or if all Chriſtians had this ſtrict obligation, ſurely the Apoſtles, and theyr ſucceſſours would have made this known, and they would have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de both Prieſts, and Chriſtians do theyr duty in this kind.</hi> For they only ſaying this, would have (then) been enough to have ſtopped this mans mouth. Neither is the Doctrine of Confeſſion, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it ſo eaſy to be brought in, that it could poſſibly be thus ſilently and ſpeedily entertained yea and entertained all the Chriſtian world over, without contradiction, or oppoſition, even ſo much as in any one ſingle place, for we no where heare of any ſuch contradiction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I know after Confeſſion was every where practized, that the Novatian Heretiks did oppoſe it ſaying, that <hi>it was a dishonour to God that man should forgive ſins.</hi> But all Catholicks hould this to be an Hereſie in them. And S. Ambroſe ſayth to them Luk 1. c. 7.
<hi>Why should it be more a dishonour to God, or be more inconvenient, that man should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins by Pennance, then by Baptiſme, ſeeing it is the Holy Ghoſt who in both caſes doth it by the miniſtery of the Prieſts:</hi> So he. In Baptiſme the Prieſt ſays: <hi>I Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſe thee,</hi> that is,
<hi>I wash thee,</hi> I aske from what? ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely from ſin, according to that Act. 22.16. <hi>Riſe up and be baptized and wash away thy ſins.</hi> I aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain can your Prieſts or Miniſters waſh ſin away? You will anſwer that they can adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <pb n="134" facs="tcp:59494:74"/> which waſheth ſin away and ſo they waſh away ſin, not by theyr own power, but as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſts Sacraments. Iuſt ſo each Prieſt ſayeth: <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> yet our Prieſts abſolve not by theyr owne power but as Miniſters of Chriſt they adminiſter the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of abſolution, which cancels all ſinns. Laſtly I obſerve that when Chriſt did forgive the Paralitick his ſins Matth. 9. the multitude was ſo farr from ſaying this was a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God, that <hi>the multitude glorified God who gave ſuch power unto men.</hi> v. 8.</p>

                  <hi>THE XVII. POINT.</hi> Of the Sacrament of Extreme vnction.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe very name of this Sacrament is grown even vnheard of to us here in England, who boaſt ſo much of the word of God. And yet, according to the word of God, there is not any Sacrament at all, which can be more manifeſtly proved a true Sacrament the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, both in regard of the outwatd or viſible ſigne, or in regard of the inviſible grace. This viſible ſigne is proved evidently to have been inſtituted by our Saviour, becauſe no body but he, could annex the guift of of inviſible grace to this viſible ſigne, to which ſigne moſt cleare Scripture doth teſtifie this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to be annexed. For ſo we read. Iam. 5.14. <hi>Is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59494:74"/> any man ſick among you? Lett him bring in the Prieſts of the Church and lett them pray over him annoynting him with oyle in the name of our Lord.</hi> (Behold the viſible outward ſigne of this Sacrament) And, in the next words, behold the inviſible grace anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed there unto. <hi>And if he be in ſins they shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him.</hi> Now (good Proteſtant) give me leave to aske thee this one queſtion; is there any time in which it more imports a man to have ſo good a warrant, as Gods word is for the remiſſion of his ſins, then in the time of his departure out of this world? Behold then here a meanes to obteyne this remiſſion, even at this very time, and this meanes warranted by the very word of God. And yet without any ground at all, in Gods word, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve rejected a thing ſo importing all Chriſtians though you found the practice of all Chriſtianity to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the words as they ſound; how doth this ſtand with your pretence of reforming our errours by the Rule of Scripture, you go ſo flatly contrary to cleare Scripture even in a point of aboliſhing a Sacrament which was uſed by all the Catholick Church before your Reformation and having ſo clear a Text for it and no one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Text againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To take away the force of this Text, firſt in place of <hi>Prieſts</hi> you are pleaſed, againſt all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to read
<hi>Elders,</hi> becauſe the Greek word that ſignifieth <hi>Prieſts,</hi> in vulgar uſe ſignifieth <hi>Elders.</hi> 
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59494:75"/> Now this is as ridiculous as if one would ſay <hi>The Bigger of the Cittie</hi> in place of ſaying the <hi>Major of the Citty,</hi> becauſe the word <hi>Major</hi> ſignifyeth the <hi>Bigger,</hi> or as if, for the like cauſe, you would call <hi>a Doctor of Phyſick a teacher of Phiſick,</hi> wheras <hi>a Doctor</hi> is well known to ſignifie ſuch a degree, as allſo <hi>a Major</hi> is notoriouſly known to ſignify a ſecular office, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity in a citty, ſo the name put in Greek for a prieſt <hi>Presbyteros</hi> is as notoriouſly known to ſignifie a <hi>Prieſt</hi> endued with a Prieſtly order, office and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Church of God. Whence this name is improperly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated <hi>Elder</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeach is manifeſtly of Church affaires as here ſpeach is of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery or other, at which ſins are forgiven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I know that thoſe who graunt that here is a command (for Counſels you will have none) to uſe annoynting of the ſick with true oyle, pretend that this was commanded to be done only for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning a miraculous Cure. A doctrine full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. The <hi>firſt</hi> of which is <hi>novelty.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is flatt contradiction to the Text expreſſing the chief effect to be ſought for (not to be the health of the body but of the ſoul, <hi>and if he be in ſins they shall be forgiven him.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> abſurdity is to ſay there was in the Church (for a time) a commaund to any one ſick among us to ſeek for a miraculous cure. The <hi>fourth</hi> is to ſay that any Prieſt, or Elder, whatſoever might be called in to work this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous cure. Vpon what authority of Scripture or <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59494:75"/> Hiſtory is this ſayd? Give me leave in the laſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to aske if ever you did either read, or heare, that at the uſe of any element, which was not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, ſins were promiſſed to be forgiven by any one, even of Chriſts Apoſtles?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Other of your Doctors will have this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting with oyle to be only the oyle of devout prayers, or Charity. But firſt where have you that, at your Elders, or Prieſts prayer, it will follow that <hi>if the ſick man be in ſins they shall be forgiven him.</hi> Do not you ſcoff at Prieſts forgiving ſins, and will you now allow a ſure warrant atteſted by Gods own word, that at the Prieſts prayers, yea at the Elders, the ſick mans ſinns ſhall be forgiven? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this free licence of interpreting
<hi>Oyle</hi> to be Prayer or Charity, opens a gappe to interprete all that is ſayd of applying water in Baptiſme, to be underſtood only of applying the cleare, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtreames of heavenly doctrine teaching them to believe in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, without ever caſting water on them. Again, did ever any Holy Father thus interprete this place of S. Ieames? Shall I, upon your never heard of Interpretation go and forſake a remedy taught me by the practice of all the Church, and by ſo cleare a Text, upon which remedy the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes of my ſins at the houre of my death, and conſequently my eternall ſaluation may depend? God give me my witts, and I will never do it.</p>

                  <hi>THE XIX. POINT.</hi> Of the Sacrament of Matrimony.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHen (Gen. 2. v. 22.) our Lord <hi>had built the ribbe which he tooke of Adam, into a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and brought her to Adam, Adam ſayd, this now is the flesh of my flesh, wherefore man shall leave his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, and shall cleave to his wyfe, and they shall be one flesh.</hi> In the new Teſtament (Matth. 19. v. 5. Mar. 10. v. 7.) our Saviour repeats thoſe words, and hence inferreth. <hi>Therefore they are not two, but one flesh.</hi> Then of himſelfe he adds. <hi>That therefore which God hath joyned together lett not man ſeparate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now S. Paul repeating part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words here cyted, ſayth. <hi>This is a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (wee read Sacrament) <hi>but I ſpeake in Chriſt, and in the Church.</hi> Eph. 5.31. Although S. Paul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth here the very name of <hi>Sacrament</hi> to Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which name is not once in all Scripture applyd to any of the other Sacraments) yet it is not from hence we inferre Matrimony to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for by that word in this place, we know he only meanes a myſtery, yet a Sacramentall My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: But we inferre out of his diſcourſe, that this myſtery is now elevated by Chriſt, to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe S. Paul citeth the words of Chriſt ſpoaken (as wee have ſeene out of S. Matthew)
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59494:77"/> when he did abrogate the law of Moyſes (which Law permitted in ſeverall caſes, husband and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to be ſeparated) and ſpoaken allſo when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared expreſly that he would have this contract made hereafter inſeparable; ſaying. <hi>That which God hath joyned together, lett no man ſeparate.</hi> Chriſt then marrying to his Church for ever would elevate this chiefe contract, that is in mankinde (which he made from that time to be an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract) to ſignify this moſt ſacred Myſtery and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore he ſayth; <hi>This is a great Sacrament or Myſtery,</hi> ſo much, and ſo neerly <hi>concerning Chriſt and the Church,</hi> as S. Paul tels us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may here note the impiety of them, who knowing by S. Paul, that Chriſt thus inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably had wedded his Church, do notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding preſume to call this his beloved ſpouſe a <hi>whore and a harlot,</hi> for her ſuperſtition, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But to proceed; marriage being elevated by Chriſt to be a <hi>great Sacrament,</hi> or ſacred Myſtery, and to ſignify the inſeparable conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him ad his Church, a ſignification ſo farre beyond its owne nature (which was only to be a civill contract) he made it a fitt Ceremonie to which now he might annexe his grace given (to the parties joyned by this Sacrament) to obſerve Matrimoniall Continency. <hi>That euery one may know to poſſeſſe his veſſel in ſanctification and honour, and not in paſsion of luſt, as Gentills.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 4.4. They
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59494:77"/> therefore having this grace, given to this end, are thereby enabled more fittly to expreſſe in theyr mutuall fidelity and affection, the mutuall fidelity and affection which ſhould be for ever betweene Chriſt and his Church. This is the proper effect of the grace given in Matrimony.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this our doctrine of Matrimony, lett any impartiall man judge whether wee, or our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, honour it more; they, having taken this chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe honour of being a Sacrament from it (which wee allow to it) are now come to celebrate it in prophane houſes, before Iuſtices, and this only for civill ends intended by the common wealth.

                  <hi>THE XX. POINT.</hi> Of the ſingle life of Prieſts.</head>
               <p n="1">1. MAtrimony being a Sacrament and giving grace, it may ſeeme to ſome that all ſhould do better to make themſelves partaker of this grace. I anſwer that the want of this one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is more then abundantly recompenſed by tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe many great, and often received graces, of which a ſingle life makes us farre more capable, as of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving more frequently and worthily the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59494:78"/> of Sacraments the Body and blood of our Lord, which Prieſts dayly do with great encreaſe of greater graces; very ſingular graces allſo are obteyned by prayer, to which Chaſtity doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly conduce, as Scriptures teach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lett us heare the Scripture 1. Luke 23. <hi>And it came to paſſe that after the dayes of his office we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re expired he,</hi> (Zacharias the Prieſt) <hi>departed into his houſe: And after theſe dayes Elizabeth his wyfe concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Hence it appearrs to be true, which S. Ierom ſayth contra Iouian: L. 1. c. 19. and Ep. 50. c. 3. That, even in the old Law, the Prieſts, who offered the Holy Hoſt for the people, did not ſo much as ſtay in theyr owne houſes; but were purifyed, and ſo ſeparated (for that time) from theyr wyves. Whence the Scripture ſayth.
<hi>After the dayes of his office, he departed into his houſe;</hi> and,
<hi>after thoſe dayes his wyfe conceaved.</hi> Our Prieſts of the new Law being to offer dayly ſacrifice, are dayly to obſerve virginall purity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again even in married Laymen, S. Paul approves abſtayning from theyr wyves. <hi>For a time that they may give themſelves to prayer.</hi> 1. Cor. 7.35. <hi>And this</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>I ſpeake to your profit not to caſt a ſnare upon you, but for that which is comely. And that you may attend upon the Lord without diſtraction.</hi> Prieſts therefore, who dayly ſhould be attending vpon our Lord, and praying for themſelves and the people and ſo often allſo ſacrificing, ſhould
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59494:78"/> dayly abſtaine from woemen, as S. Ierom argueth L. 1. c. 19. contra Iovian.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly</hi> 1. Cor. 7.32. <hi>He that is without a wyfe is carefull of the things that perteine to our Lord, how to pleaſe God: But he that is with à wyfe, is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of things that perteine to the world.</hi> Prieſts ſhould ſtill be in a ſtate moſt capable of being
<hi>carefull of things that perteine to God, and how to pleaſe him.</hi> Therefore they ſhould not have wives. <hi>For he that is with a wyfe is carefull of things that perteine to the world,</hi> which Prieſts ſhould not be. But if any men ſurely Prieſts, chiefly, ſhould be the men,
<hi>who geld themſelves for the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Matth. 19.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly. <hi>No man being a ſouldier to God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelfe in the affayres of this life, that they may pleaſe him, who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier.</hi> 2. Tim. 2.4. Of all men, Clergy men, ſhould take care to pleaſe him, who hath choſen them to be ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to him, and therefore they, of all men, ſhould not <hi>enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves with ſecular buſineſſes,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires.

To mainteyn them thus, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the benefitt of a benefice (enjoyable at the furtheſt during life and perhaps to be taken away farre ſooner) there is a kinde of neceſſity for them to make hay a pace which the Sunne ſhine, they not knowing how little while that may be, and knowing that it cannot be long. But let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fiftly, <hi>It behoveth therefore a Bishop to be the husband of one wyfe.</hi> 1. Tim. 3.3. In the firſt Birth of Chriſtianity, Virginity was ſo rare both among Iewes, and Gentiles, that it was not poſſible to find men endewed therewith, who were both of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient maturity in yeares, and knowledge, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in affaires, as is requiſite in Biſhops and Prieſts. Yet, even then, the Apoſtles would have this at leaſt obſerved, that no man, who married a ſecond wyfe, ſhould be made a Biſhop; no nor a Deacon. And therefore not a Prieſt. And thus this place is underſtood by the Councels, and Fathers unanimouſly. See the Rhemiſh Teſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on this place. But as for marrying after Prieſthoode receaved, it is a thing wholy unheard of in Gods Church.
<hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there one Authenticall example thereof in the whole world,</hi> as the ſame Rhemiſts ſay. S. Paul adds yet further. <hi>Let the Deacons be the Husbands of one wyfe.</hi> v. 12.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Ridiculous is the Interpretation of thoſe who ſay S. Paul would only have ſuch made Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59494:79"/> Prieſts, Biſhops, who have but one wyfe at once. For this is to require no more then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of all Chriſtians. If you ſay, he yet requires of them that they never had at one and the ſame time more wyfes then one before theyr Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, this is ſhewed evidently not to expreſſe the meaning of theſe words, for he uſeth juſt the ſame words, and the lyke expreſſion, when he could have no ſuch meaning. For c. 5. where he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of chooſing a widdow (for the end there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) he in lyke manner ſayth, <hi>she should be a widdow having bene the wife of one man,</hi> v. 9. How ridiculous is it to ſay that here (where there is juſt the ſame expreſſion) the meaning is, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch ſhould be choſen to be widdows (for the end here appointed) who had had but one hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at one time before her Converſion. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewes, nor Gentiles, did ever permit woemen to have more husbands then one at once. It had bene therefore ridiculous to requyre that which could not but be.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Your chiefe objection againſt all this, (as all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt vowed Virginity) is that you conceave S. Paul 1. Tim. 4.3. to teach that this is <hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils forbidding to marry.</hi> I anſwer that S. Paul ſpeaks only againſt the doctrine of Heretiks, (cited by the Rhemiſts here to which adde the Manicheans, and others) who taught that the uſe of marriage came from a bad God or Devil. As <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59494:80"/> for us we honour marriage more then you, for wee hould it to be a Sacrament, which you do not. Neither can you ſay that wee abſolutely forbid marriage, becauſe we forbid, or rather declare marriage to be by God forbidden, to thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, who wittingly and willingly have either vowed Virginity, when they might have married, if they pleaſed, or who wittingly and willingly (when they might as freely have married) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke Holy Orders, to which ſtate they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne were admitted but ſuch as would voluntarily and freely profeſſe Virginity. For the Church now, abounding with very ſufficient choyſe of worthy perſons, who will voluntarily make ſuch vowes, and undertake freely ſuch a profeſſion, will admitt no others to Holy Orders, becauſe ſhe is taught, (in all the texts I cited in the beginning) that theſe be the fitteſt. With us therefore there is no man, or woman, who might not have married if they would. And therefore wee cannot be ſayd <hi>to forbid marriage,</hi> unleſſe you will ſay that S. Paul did forbid marriage, when he forbad Biſhops, Deacons, and vowed widdows to paſſe to ſecond marriage. This is only to forbid breaking of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes to ſuch, as voluntarily would make them, when they might freely have married.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Your other objections be foule corruptions of Scripture. The firſt of them is this 1. Cor. 9.5. <hi>Have we not power to leade about a woman a ſiſter, as <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59494:80"/> allſo the reſt of the Apoſtles, and our Lords Brother and Cephas.</hi> Here in place of a
<hi>woman,</hi> your Bibles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de a <hi>wyfe,</hi> making the H. Ghoſt reſtreyn the word <hi>gynaika</hi> to a wyfe, though it is knowne that this word is vſually put for a <hi>woman,</hi> whether wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, or not wyfe. Here the Rhemiſh Teſtament ſhewes how Antiquity ever expounded this place of leading about ſuch devout woemen as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Chriſt <hi>to miniſter to him.</hi> Matth. 27.55. I could thus have maintayned my ſelfe, (ſayth S. Paul) or by partaking of your temporall goods, to whome I give ſpirituall goods. But to burthen no body, I (being a tradſman) have made it my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to maintaine my ſelfe by the labour of my ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne hands. Yea your owne Bible but two chapters before tranſlated the ſelfeſame Greeke word, for ſuch a woeman as could not be a vvyfe. 1. Cor. 7.1. <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a woeman.</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te (if you dare) <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a wife gynaika.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſecond corrupt Text you object is Heb. 13. v.
4. For where we reade word for word out of the Greek, <hi>Marriage honorable in all,</hi> you reade, <hi>Marriage is honorable in all men</hi> adding the verbe
<hi>is,</hi> and the nowne <hi>men;</hi> yet your beſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have not this nowne <hi>(Men)</hi> and they print this verbe <hi>(is)</hi> in a different letter. As allſo in the former text they did print the word <hi>woeman</hi> in the margent. This jugling the vulgar perceives not. <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59494:81"/> And the Bibles uſed it to make them take for the true Text, that which is but theyr interpretation of it. But if a man would preſume to add a Verbe, which ſhould come as neere as may be, to the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the Apoſtle, then he ſhould put the verbe in the Imparative moode thus. <hi>Lett marriage be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all.</hi> For S. Paul uſeth this moode in the firſt verſe.
<hi>Lett Brotherly love continue;</hi> and in the ſecond, <hi>Be not unmindfull,</hi> &amp;c. And in the third verſe. <hi>Remember them in bonds.</hi> The fourth verſe being, that we ſpeake of, ſhould be likewiſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Verbe in that moode, eſpecially ſeeing he ſtill goeth on in that moode in the fift verſe, <hi>let your converſation be without Covetouſnes.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſence then ſeems clearly to be. <hi>Lett Marriage be honorable in all.</hi> That is, lett no man diſhonour his marriage bed with either unfaithfullnes to his ſpouſe, or with vnnatural or brutiſh luſt, and ſo his next words very fitly are.
<hi>For God will judge forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catours ad adulterers.</hi> But your Bible by a double impoſture maks a quyte different ſence. The firſt is to put the Verbe in the Indicative Moode, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honorable,</hi> and becauſe this alone helped not much, you uſed a ſecond impoſture in the words following, which in Greeke are, <hi>en paſi</hi> in Latin <hi>In omnibus.</hi> And in both languages all Schollers ſee that there is doubt whether this ſhould ſignify, <hi>in all men.</hi> (taking the Adjective in the maſculine gender) or <hi>in all things</hi> taking it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59494:81"/> in the neuter gender. Our Bibles leave it as they find it
<hi>in all.</hi> But your Bible undertaks abſolutely to determine the ſence of the Holy Ghoſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke him ſay roundly, <hi>Marriage is honorable among all men,</hi> Thus your Bible, Anno 1577. Yea, <hi>Inter quoſvis,</hi> ſayth Beza, 1565. that is, <hi>Marriage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable among any kinde of perſons.</hi> Out of which new Scripture the people eaſily inferre, Marriage is honorable among thoſe who have receaved Holy Orders, or have made Vows of Virginity: and the text being thus ſtretcht, they might adde,
<hi>Among Brothers and Siſters, Father and Daughter.</hi> But wee ſhall (in the next point, n. 5.) ſhew how flatly this Conſequence is contrary to S. Paul, who plainly denounceth damnation to ſuch as have marryed after they vowed Chaſtity. Your obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſufficiently anſwered by having ſhewed a double corruption in the text alledged, as many of you doe alledge it.</p>

                  <hi>THE XXI. POINT.</hi> Of the ſingle life of ſuch as have vowed perpetuall Chaſtity.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HOw commendable works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are) by which we voluntarily do what we are not commanded, and obſerve that, which is of Counſel, and not of precept) we ſhall <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59494:82"/> ſee in the next point. Yet here we cannot but ſpeake ſome thing to ſhew how much the vowing of Chaſtity is counſeled, and recommended, and ſhew allſo how ſtrictly thoſe, who vow Chaſtity, are obliged to keepe theyr vowes, which volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, they made. Numbers 30.3. <hi>If any man make a vow to our Lord to bind himſelfe by an oath, he shall not make his word fruſtrate, but all that he promiſed he shall fulfill.</hi> Whence S. Aug. q. 56. in Num. <hi>He that voweth abſtinence from a thing lawfull, maketh it unlawfull to himſelfe by his vow.</hi> Now that you may evidently ſee that the Scripture ſpeaketh here of vowes made in matters not commanded, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. <hi>If a woeman vow any thing, and binde herſelf with an oath she that is in her fathers houſe, and as yet in Maidens age, if her father know the vow, she promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the oath wherewith she bound her ſoule, and held his peace, she shall be bound to the vow: whatſoever she promiſed and ſware, she shall fulfull indeede. But if immediately as he heares it, her father doth gainſay it, both her vows and her oath, shall be fruſtrate, neither shall she be bound to the promiſe.</hi> The ſame he ſayth of the vows of a wyfe, that they ſhall hold, if her husband hold his peace, <hi>but if he gaineſay it, he shall make her vow fruſtrate.</hi> Who ſees not that it could not be, either in the power of the father to <hi>make his daughters vows voyde,</hi> or of the husband <hi>to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> and annul the <hi>vows of his wyfe,</hi> if they had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed things which they ſtood obliged to performe <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59494:82"/> by commandments from God? For example if ſhee ſhould vow to faſt in the feaſt of expiation, her husband could not have made her vow voyd by gaineſaying it. For the Law obligeth her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Levit. 23. v. 29. <hi>Every ſoule that is not afflicted, that is,</hi> which faſteth not <hi>this day, shall perish out of his people.</hi> By this you ſee that the Scripture here ſpeaketh of vows made to do that, to which they were not otherwiſe obliged. But after the vow, they ſtand now obliged to fulfill indeede, what they promiſed by word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take a further evident proof of this. Deut. 23. v. 21.
<hi>When thou haſt vowed a vow to our Lord thy God, thou shalt not ſlack to pay it, becauſe our Lord thy God will require it, and if thou delay, it shall be deputed unto the for ſin. If thou wilt not promiſe, thou shalt be without ſinne. But that which is once gone out of thy lipps, thou shalt obſerve, and shalt doe, as thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to our Lord thy God, and haſt ſpoaken with thy proper will and thy owne mouth.</hi> What could be ſaid more manifeſt to prove, that where there was no kind of <hi>Sin</hi> or breach of obligation before, now there is a ſin by the breach of a moſt ſtrait obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion arriſing from this vow. Againe Eccl. c. 5. 4.
<hi>Whatſoever thou haſt vowed pay it. And it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to vow, then after a vow not to performe the thing promiſed.</hi> For this is a
<hi>ſin,</hi> as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the former unanſwerable Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the particular vow of Chaſtity we
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59494:83"/> have our Saviours owne words. Matth. 19.12. <hi>And there be Eunuchs who have made themſelves Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs for the Kingdome of heaven. Thoſe geld themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves for the Kingdome of heaven, who vow Chaſtity,</hi> ſayth S. Aug. de Virg. c. 27. For by vow they make themſelves as it were impotent for marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge. And the doing this <hi>for the Kingdome of heaven</hi> is a cleare proofe, that this ſtate doth much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards obteyning heaven. Again both vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Poverty and Chaſtity are particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by our Lord. Luc. 18.29. <hi>There is no man who hath left either houſe parents, or wyfe, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> (Note ſtill how Chaſtity furthers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Kingdome of God) <hi>who shall not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve manifold more at this preſent time, and in the world to come lyfe everlaſting.</hi> Here I find a reward for leaving a wyfe, ſhew me a reward for marrying one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. S. Paul is moſt cleare 1. Cor. 7.25. <hi>As concerning Virgins, a command of our Lord I have not, yet I give my judgement or counſel,</hi> (can you give bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter counſel or judgement, which is)
<hi>Art thou looſed from a wyfe, ſeeke not a wyfe.</hi> Why ſo? It follows v. 32. <hi>He that is without a wyfe is carefull of the things that pertaine to our Lord, how he may pleaſe God.</hi> (No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſtill how Chaſtity conduces to the gaining hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>But he thas is with a wyfe is carefull of the things that pertaine to the world. The Virgin thinketh of things that pertaine to our Lord, that she may be Holy <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59494:83"/> both in body and ſpirit. But she that is married thinketh of things that pertaine to the world.</hi> And v. 38. <hi>He that joyneth not his Virgin in Matrimony doth better.</hi> And v. 40. <hi>But she is happier, if she ſo abide, after my judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Againe 1. Tim. 5.9. <hi>Lett a widdow be choſen which hath beene the wyfe of one husband.</hi> Here he ſpeaks of the choiſe of ſuch widdows as then were deputed to the ſervice of the Church, in aſſiſting to prepare weomen Cathecumens to Baptiſme, as allſo to ſerve the ſick, to adminiſter to the poore, eſpecially of theyr owne ſex. And this they did, living under the charge of the Deacons, whence they were called <hi>Diaconiſſae.</hi> S. Paul here ſayth, he would have none choſen, or taken to this kind of ſtate, who had been marryed more then to
<hi>one man.</hi> Neither doth he permitt them (after they have once undertaken this ſtate) to marry again. That hence you may ſee evidently, how farre he was from permitting Prieſts to marry again after the ſtate of Prieſthood undertaken: Heare his diſcourſe c. 5. n. 11. <hi>Younger widdows avoyde,</hi> (in this choyce) <hi>for when they have begun to wax wanton again,</hi> (that is, well fedd by Church goods offered to Chriſt, as thoſe widdows were) <hi>they will marry having damnation. becauſe they have caſt of theyr firſt ſaith. Behold here theyr marriage, and theyr damnation</hi> joyned together, and the reaſon given why they have incurred <hi>Kryma damnation or judgment, <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59494:84"/> to theyr condemnation,</hi> to witt, <hi>becauſe they have caſt of theyr firſt faith.</hi> This firſt faith is theyr vow of keeping perpetuall widdowhood, <hi>according to all Fathers Greeke and Latin, who ever did write upon this place,</hi> ſayth the Rhemiſh Teſtament here citing allſo S. Aug. <hi>who together with two hundred and five-tenne Fathers</hi> in the fourth Councell of Carthage ſpeaketh thus. <hi>If any widdows have vowed themſelves to God, and left theyr laicall habit, and under the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Bishop, or Church, have appeared in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious weede, and afterwards go any more to ſecular marriage, according to the Apoſtles ſentence, they shall be damned, becauſe they were ſo bold as to make voide the faith or promiſe of Chaſtity, which they vowed to our Lord.</hi> And as S. Auguſtin ſayth (Hereſi 82.)
<hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian the Heretike was the firſt who induced vowed Virgins to marry.</hi> And l. 3. Retr. c. 22. for this his new doctrine, he calls him a

               <p n="1">1. PRoteſtants deny all works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, works which we, of our owne ſelves, ſuperadde to our bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> duty; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they will have no good worke to be only counſeled unto vs, but they ſay we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do all the good we can. Againſt this errour be allmoſt all the texts in the former point, and particularly the Text I there cited n. 1. out of the Booke of Numbers, and what I cited n. 4. out of S. Paul, flatly ſaying. <hi>Concerning Virgins a commaund of our Lord I have not, but Counſel I give.</hi> And agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <hi>art thou looſe from a wyfe? ſeeke not a wyfe.</hi> Is this a commaund? Woe then to Miniſters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying when they were free men. If it be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, what can it be but a Counſel? And again <hi>He that ioyneth not his Virgin in Matrimony doth better,</hi> to witt, by doing ſomething which you dare not ſay he is commaunded, but which S.

<hi>More happy</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>shall shee be, if shee remaine ſo, according to my judgment or Counſel.</hi> Is thine better?</p>
               <p>To the proofe of this point make all thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold Texts, which in the next point we ſhall <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59494:85"/> bring, to prove how commendable voluntary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterityes be, for none of thoſe auſterityes be by any precept commaunded, but only commended to us; and ſo they be not of precept, but of Counſel, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to what we are commaunded, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore they be works of ſupererogation. See all thoſe Texts, for they be moſt convincing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Law of nature, I find Iacob freely, without being commaunded, vowing to build a Church, Gen. 28. v. 20. <hi>And he vowed a vow ſaying, if God shall keepe me in the way, and I shall be returned proſperouſly to my Fathers houſe, this ſtone, which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſet for a pillar, shall be Gods houſe.</hi> Which he being ſafely returned, did fullfill. c. 35. v. 6. <hi>Iacob came to Luza ſurnamed Bethel, and he built there an Altar, and called that place the houſe of God.</hi>

                  <hi>THE XXIII. POINT.</hi> Of voluntary auſterity of life.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I handle this point apart, becauſe there being ſuch dayly practiſe of theſe kind of works in our Religion, and ſo little in our adverſaryes, (they ſcoffing at all we do, or ſuffer, in this point) we will ſhew whether they ſcoffe not at the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59494:87"/> of vertue recommended by Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt then obſerve all that hath beene ſayd in the laſt point doth recommend auſterity of life, by counſelling a chaſt life, which cannot be maintayned unleſſe the fleſh be tamed by ſome auſterityes: neither is Chaſtity it ſelfe a ſmall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. Note allſo that they who in the old Law (Numb. 6.) <hi>Had a will to ſeparate themſelves to God,</hi> had allſo a will to chooſe an auſtere life, abſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from wyne, the uſuall drinke of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. How great and voluntary was the auſterity of the Rechabites or ſonns of Ionadab, who
<hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did drinke wyne, nor built houſes</hi> (but lodged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in tabernacles) <hi>nor poſſeſſed vineyeards nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed corne or any ſeede.</hi> And yet how doth God prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and reward them for it? Ieremy
35.18. How great and how voluntary was the auſterity of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith, living
<hi>ſixty nine yeares in Chaſtity,</hi> in upper roomes retyred from the world, allmoſt in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall faſt, continuall hayre cloath, moſt frequent prayer ſhe being ſo rich, and (when ſhe began this courſe) ſo younge and ſo beautifull? Chriſt allſo counſelled no ſmall voluntary auſterity, to him whome he adviſed for greater perfection to
<hi>ſell all,</hi> for money being the price of all commodities, the want of it brings all incommodities. He was adviſed allſo to follow him, <hi>who had not a hole to shroud his head in.</hi> What auſterity is here counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59494:87"/>3. Much like this was the voluntary auſterity of the firſt Chriſtians, forſaking money, the price both of all delights, and allſo of all convenient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation: and yet Act. 4. v.
34. <hi>As many as we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re owners of lands, or houſes, ſold and brought the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe things which they ſold, and caryed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the feete of the Apoſtles.</hi> Who commaunded this? Love of ſerving God more perfectly: For if we ſpeake of any obligation, they had no other then we have. Hence S. Peter to Ananias. c. 5. v. 4. <hi>Whiles it remained was it not thine owne, and after it was ſold in thyne owne power?</hi> That is, thou
<hi>hadſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> to keepe it wholy to thy ſelfe, or to vow it wholy to God, after which vow thou hadſt no further power to keepe it, according to what we proved fully out of Scripture, Point 21. n. 1.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But to ſpeake more particularly of that which we call auſterity of life, ſuch as that of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith was, both great and voluntary, as allſo that of Rechabites, or Sonns of Ionadab: how great and voluntary was the auſterity of Holy David though a King? <hi>His knees were weake through faſting.</hi> Pſal. 109.24. <hi>I am weary with my groaning. All the night make I my bed to ſwimme. I water my couch with my teares.</hi> Pſal. 6. v.
6. <hi>By reaſon of the voice of my groaning, my boanes have cleaved to my skin.</hi> Pſ. 102. v. 5. <hi>I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drinke with weeping.</hi> v. 9. His prayers allſo farre exceeded any commaund given him. Pſal. 119. <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59494:88"/> 148. <hi>Mine eyes have prevented the nights watches, that I might meditate thy word, I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried.</hi> And v. 62. <hi>At midnight I will riſe to give thanks to thee.</hi> And v. 97. <hi>Thy Law is my Meditation all day.</hi> And
164. <hi>Seven times a day</hi> I <hi>do prayſe the.</hi> Daniel c. 9.3. of himſelfe ſayth. <hi>I did put my face to my Lord God to beſeech and pray him in faſtings, ſackcloath and ashes.</hi> And Nehemiah 9. v. 1. <hi>The Children of Iſraël came together in faſting and ſackclaths and earth upon them.</hi> What the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites did is wel knowne. Of Iacob as wealthy as he was, the Scripture tells us, how ſleeping on the ground, <hi>he uſed a ſtone for his pillow,</hi> and ſo was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored with that heavenly viſion: Gen. 28.11. ſo all Iſraël is ſayd Ioël 2.12. <hi>Turne ye to me with all your heart, with faſting, with weeping, and with mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Now in the new Teſtament Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine would have made the great ſinners of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and Sidon, <hi>do pennance in ſackloath and ashes.</hi> Matth. 11. v. 21.

<hi>The Child grew and waxed in ſpirit, and was in the deſert untill the day of of his Manifeſtation or shewing in Iſraël.</hi> v. 80.

And he did eate ſo ſparingly, that of him Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Iohn came neither eating nor drinking.</hi> Matth. 11.18. Of his Diſciples <hi>often faſting</hi> we reade Matth. 9. v. 14. And they were inſtructed by him of whome Chriſt ſayd, <hi>amongſt the Children of woemen there hath not riſen a greater then Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Chriſt allſo promiſed the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that his Diſciples ſhould do as Iohns did, that is, <hi>faſt often,</hi> when <hi>the Bridgrome should be taken from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. They did but what S. Paul taught 2. Cor. 6. v. 4.
<hi>In all things approving our ſelves as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God in much patience, in tribulations, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsityes, in diſtreſſes, in ſtrypes, in priſons, in ſeditions.</hi> To theſe (which all perhaps were not voluptary) he exhorts us, voluntarily to adde. <hi>In labours, in watchings, in faſting, in pureneſſe or Chaſtity.

                  <hi>THE XXIV. POINT.</hi> Of ſatisfactory good workes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THeſe voluntary auſterities (of which we ſpoake in the former point) and all ſuch painfull and laborious good workes, when they are performed in ſtate of grace, are held by vs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks to have a great ſatisfactory vertue, by which the paine due to our ſin, is forgiven, and is more, or leſſe cancelled, as the works are more, or leſſe perfect. For wee teach that after the ſin it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe is forgiven, by our true repentance and humble Confeſſion, there yet remaines the guilt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paine, to which that ſin makes us ſtill lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I ſhall prove in the next point, which (if you pleaſe) you may reade before this. Proteſtants thinke they much magnify the Paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by ſaying that, by vertue of that alone, all ſinns and all paine due to all ſinns, are quite forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But firſt I aske them if nothing elſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our parts? They are forced to confeſſe ſomething elſe required: for they are conſtrained to acknowledge <hi>Firſt</hi> that we muſt be baptized, <hi>Secondly</hi> that we muſt lay hould of the Paſſion of Chriſt by the hand of Faith. <hi>Thirdly</hi> that beſids this faith wee muſt have true repentance. <hi>Fourthly</hi> they muſt needs ſay, that allſo you muſt have a will to <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59494:90"/> receave the Body and Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Vnleſſe you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, you shall not have life in you.</hi> Io. 6.53.
<hi>Fiftly</hi> they muſt needs allſo ſay, that either the obſervation of the commaundements is neceſſary, (as we ſhall ſhew point 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) or at leaſt a good will, and ſerious endeavour to keepe them. <hi>He was made to all that obey him the cauſe of eternall ſaluation.</hi> Hebr. 5.9. So that <hi>obeying him</hi> is required on our parts, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve him be effectually to us, <hi>the cauſe of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By this diſcourſe it is evident, that though the Paſſion of Chriſt in it ſelfe be of a ſufficient worth, and value, to ſatisfy for all the ſinns of the world, yea of a million of worlds, and allſo for all the paine that is, or can be due to thoſe ſinns; yet Chriſt, (out of his Prudence and Iuſtice) thought fit to order ſo, that this full fruit of his Paſſion ſhould not be applyed to any, but ſuch, as ſhould performe ſeverall things which he requires at theyr hands for this effect. Not that there is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of this to ſupply any want of value in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but there is neede to do all this, to fullfill, on our parts, the Covenant, and conditions, upon which this benefitt is graunted. As you muſt ſay of all thoſe five ſeverall things, which, you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves require to be ſuperadded by us on our part, that we may enjoy the full fruit of his Paſſion. To theſe five things we Roman Catholicks adde a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59494:90"/> ſixth, and we have Scripture for this ſixth, as well as you have, for the other five. That ſixth thing is, that Chriſt requires of us ſeverall penall, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious works, which though in themſelues, and as they meerely proceede from us, they have no ſufficient proportion to cancell the paines due unto our ſins (as allſo you muſt confeſſe all that is done by us in Baptiſme, or in believing, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, or in receaving his body, or in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keepe his Law, hath allſo no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) yet each of them have vertue to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: But this vertue is meerely from the vertue of the Paſſion of our Saviour, which is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us by the performance of theſe things. For wee ſo magnify the vertue of our Saviours Paſſion, that we ſay a moſt ſatisfactory vertue (or a ſpeciall efficacy to cancel paine due to ſinns) is not only communicated by it to Faith, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke efficacy, in order to this effect, is by the ſame Paſſion communicated to our painfull, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works of faſting, hayrecloath, watching, praying, almeſdeedes; and therefore this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſo farre from derogating to our Saviours Paſſion, that it honoureth it more then yours, which doth deny the Paſſion of our Saviour this praiſe, of being ſufficient to elevate, and rayſe our poore endeavours of ſatisfying to any ability of making reall ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The force and vertue of theſe actions was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59494:91"/> well known to H. David, who did practice them ſo much, as I ſhewed in the laſt point n. 4. His knees were weakned with faſting, he laboured in ſighing, he every night waſhed his bed, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his couch with his teares. The voice of his perpetuall groaning for his ſins, with other auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities joyned therewith, made his boanes cleave to his skin, he being meerely skin, and boanes: for did eate ashes as bread, and mingle his drinke with his moſt frequent teares, he gave himſelfe to prayer night and day. <hi>Every night</hi> waſhing his bed with teares, ryſing at midnight to confeſſe to our Lord, and then preventing the dawning of the day, by the cry of his morning prayers. Seven ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the day he ſayd praiſe to God, all this he did, being a King. Almeſdeeds may ſeeme leſſe wonderfull in a Royall perſon: yet his bountifull Almes, (conſidering the charge of ſo continuall warrs,) were even incredible. Towards the building of the Temple 1. Chron. 22. v. 14 <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>I, in my trouble, prepared the charges of the houſe of our Lord. Of Gold a hundred thouſand talents, and of ſilver a thouſand, thouſand talents, and of braſſe and of iron without weight, for the number is ſurpaſſed by the greatneſſe: timber and ſtoanes I have prepared to all the charges.</hi> To all this in the 29. Ch. v. 3 <hi>Above all theſe things which I have offered into the houſe of my God, I give of myne owne peculiar goods gold and ſilver unto the Temple of my God, beſids thoſe <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59494:91"/> things which I have prepared for the Holy Houſe. Three thouſand talents of the gold of Ophir, and ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents of moſt approved ſylver.</hi> Thus he excelled in all the three ſatisfactory works, <hi>Faſting, Prayer,</hi> and
<hi>Almesdeeds</hi> to which three all other ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry works are reduced. Who commaunded David this? The excellency of his Charity to God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In like manner Iob of himſelfe. <hi>I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and ashes.</hi> Iob 42.6. And as for Almes c. 31. v. 17. <hi>If I have eaten my morſels alone, and the pupil hath not eaten with me. If his ſydes have not bleſſed me; and he was not warmed with the fleeces of my sheepe. The ſtraunger tarryed noth without: my doore was open to the wayfaring man. If I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne affrayde of a very great multitude.</hi> In another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, <hi>he was an eye to the blinde, a ſtaff to the lame, &amp;c.</hi> Of Holy <hi>Iudiths</hi> actions we ſpoake in the former point. Heare what is ſayd to that wicked King by Daniel 4.24. <hi>Wherefore ô King, lett my counſel be acceptable to thee, break of thy ſinns by rightiouſneſſe, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poore.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſinns, even of Nabuchodonozar, might be cancelled by Almes.

<hi>Convert to me in all your hart in faſting, and in weeping, and in mourning, and rent your harts, and not your garments.</hi> Ionas 3 5. <hi>The men of Ninive proclaymed a faſt, and were cloathed with ſackcloath &amp;c.

<hi>faſting often,</hi> Chriſt promiſing that after his death, his allſo ſhould faſt as S. Iohns did, that is, <hi>should faſt often.</hi> Matth. 9.15. We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve S.

So that to cleanſe them by his blood, he would have theyr Almes joyned with the vertue of his blood, which blood gave this cleanſing power to theyr Almes. And S. Paul promiſeth us Rom. 8.17. <hi>That we may be Heyres of God, and Ioyntheyres with Chriſt, if ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may allſo be glorified with him,</hi> Note the condition <hi>if ſo be that we ſuffer:</hi> Though Chriſts ſuffering of its owne ſelfe be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then enough, yet he will have ours joyned, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe tearmes he covenants to communicate the full fruit of his Paſſion to us, and therefore without this be done, on our part ſomething is ſayd to be wanting to the Paſſion of Chriſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its full effect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is cleare out of Col. 1.24. <hi>I Paul who

               <p n="7">7. The obtayning of this remiſſion of all ſinns and of all paines, due to theſe ſinns, which are committed after Baptiſme, is not done with that facility and eaſines, with which all this was done in Baptiſme, but it is a thing requires much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paine, Heb. 10.26.

<hi>conſummated</hi> perfection (compleated on his part) muſt do all things, which he exacts to be done on theyr parts; that is, <hi>believe, repent, reſolue to keepe, or endeavour to keepe the Commaundements.</hi> If thus diſpoſed they ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adde Baptiſme, <hi>all is perfected</hi> wholy ſuppoſing theyr perſeverance. But if we ſin after this Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, (in which we profeſſe the knowledge of the truth receaved) <hi>there is now not an Hoſt for ſin;</hi> that is, the Hoſt of Chriſt Crucified (which is the <hi>oblation conſummating them for ever</hi>) is not left, to witt, it is not left to cancel, and cleanſe our ſins ſo eaſily as before. For none can again be baptized in cold water, but wee muſt be rebaptized in the hott water of our teares, in the baptiſme of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (for ſo the Scripture calls pennance) in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, ſackcloath, watching, praying, almeſdeeds, or elſe we muſt ſmart in Purgatory, as by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wee ſhall now prove.</p>

                  <hi>THE XXV. POINT.</hi> Of Purgatory and prayer for the Dead.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SOme are ſo ignorant in the underſtanding of Scripture, that if they find not there the name of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> they preſently conclude that according to Scripture, there is no ſuch thing as Purgatory. This is as great ſimplicity, as it would be to deny the moſt Bleſſed Trinity, becauſe this name cannot be found in all the Scripture old or new. Such men are to be taught, that any thing is ſufficiently proved out of Scripture, if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can be ſhewed to contain ſuch principles as cannot be true, unleſſe it be true allſo that there is a Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay then the Scripture holds forth vnto ut
<hi>three ſeverall principles;</hi> all which three muſt be falſe, unleſſe we grant a Purgatory. For firſt, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scripture teach, that, although our ſins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us, whenſoever we truly repent, but yet that they are only forgiven ſo, that all the paines due to them be not allwayes forgiven them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe ſins; then that very Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us allſo, that there is a Purgatory: becauſe it may often happen, that he, to whom all ſins were forgiven, did depart this life before that all the paines, due to thoſe his ſins, were remitted. <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59494:94"/> Theſe pains being due by divine Iuſtice, and not being cancelled by any ſatisfaction made for them in this world, it evidently follows, that divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice muſt exact the payment of them in the next world: but not in Hell becauſe no man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Hell, who did truly repent for his ſin. Therefore ſome other place, or ſtate, muſt needs be granted, in which ſuch a ſoule is to pay thoſe temporall puniſhments, which are yet due to her by divine Iuſtice. This place, or ſtate, is that which we call
<hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if any Scripture teach vs, that we may live and dye with ſuch ſins, as be not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only deſerve temporall puniſhment and not eternall; that Scripture allſo muſt needs teach us Purgatory, which is nothing elſe but a place in which ſouls departed ſuffer only for a time and not for eternity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if any Scripture teach us to pray for the dead that very Scripture teacheth us a Purgatory. For prayers for the dead, are unneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to thoſe, who are in heaven, and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſuch as are in Hell. Thoſe dead then, who can receive help and relief by our prayers, muſt neither be in heaven nor in Hell; but in a third place, which we call Purgatory. My work then is done, if I can ſhew <hi>that theſe three principles beheld forth unto us in Holy Scripture.</hi> Yet
<hi>fourthly</hi> we ſhall add ſeverall other Texts in proofe of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59494:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. Let us now begin with the
<hi>firſt principle,</hi> and let us ſhew how the Scripture teacheth us, that full often, after the ſin it ſelf is forgived, there do remain ſome pains, yet due even to that ſin. We are all born in Originall ſin. This ſin is quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given to many children, wether it by the faith of theyr parents (as in the Law of nature) or by Circumciſion (as in the old Law) or by Baptiſme as in the new. And yet thoſe very infants, to whom this ſin is forgiuen, do notwithſtanding for the ſelfſame forgiven ſin, ſuffer the puniſhment of death due unto them for no other cauſe, but for that very originall ſin, which was forgiven them. This is taught by S. Paul Rom. 5.12.
<hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, and by ſin death: ſo unto all death did paſſe;</hi> yea truly unto all did death paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, even to thoſe innocent Children who have not committed the leaſt offence in the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the book of Numbers, ch. 14 The people greviouſly offended God by murmuring: But Moſes praying earneſtly for them, our Lord ſaid, <hi>I have forgiuen it according to thy word. But yet all the men that have ſeen the ſignes that I have done in Aegypt, and in the wilderneſſe, they shall not ſee the Land, for which I ſware to theyr Fathers.</hi> v. 23. <hi>In this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe shall your Carcaſes lye,</hi> v. 28. and v. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Your Carcaſes shall be in the wilderneſſe: your Children shall wander in the deſert forty years, and shall bear your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, untill the Carcaſes of theyr Fathers be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59494:95"/> in the deſert. And forty yeares shall ye bear your iniquities. For as I have ſpoken ſo will I doe.</hi> Note he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that God with his own mouth ſayd, <hi>he had forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſin,</hi> and yet he with the ſame mouth, and breath, (as I may ſay) tells them there ſhall be ſtill a juſt puniſhment undergone for this very ſin, <hi>for which</hi> (though forgiven) <hi>they shall dye in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and for forty yeares theyr very Children shall bear theyr fornication;</hi> and they ſhall ſuffer all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of wandering in a wilderneſſe. Can then any man wonder, if they themſelves, who had theyr pardon on theſe termes, and then were ſlain the very next day by theyr enemies, ſhould for a time, yea perhaps for forty years, ſuffer ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment after death? Eternall puniſhment (the old ſin being forgiven) they could not ſuffer, if they did no new one; yet manifeſtly ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after death could not but be due to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing that ſo great a puniſhment was ſo juſtly laid upon theyr Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for theyr ſake, for forty whole years.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let vs go on, 2. Sam. ch. 12. vpon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids great repentance for his great ſins of Murther and Adultery, God by the Prophet Nathan tould him v. 13. <hi>Our Lord allſo hath taken away thy ſin, Howbeit becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme the Child that is borne unto thee, shall ſurely die.</hi> Behold the ſin taken away, and yet behold a puniſhment ſtill due even for this deed. Yea <hi>for this deed, the ſword shall not depart from thy houſe for ever. I will take thy wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59494:95"/> and give them to thy neighbours, and they shall ſleep with thy wives in the ſight of this Sun.</hi> v. 10.11. All which great puniſhments, even after this <hi>forgiven ſin,</hi> did befall David and his family. His ſon dyed v. 18. Three more of his own ſons were ſlain: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the next chapter; Abſolom chapter 18. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donias 1. Kings v. 24. Yea Abſolom before his death did raiſe an Army againſt David his Father and enforced him to fly, Ieruſalem being taken, they pitched a tent for Abſolom in the houſe top (the leads of the place) <hi>And he went to his Fathers Concubines before all Iſraël,</hi> 2. Sam. Ch. 16. v. 22. Thus, in the ſight of the Sun, lying with his own fathers wives, called here concubines, becauſe they were not admitted to the title of Queenes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Our Lord ſayd to Moſes and Aaron</hi> (Num.
20.12.) <hi>becauſe you have not believed me, you shall not bring this people into the land which I will give them.</hi> And v. 24. <hi>Aaron shall be gathared to his people,</hi> (that is shall dye) <hi>for he shall not enter into the land, which I have given to the Children of Iſraël, becauſe he rebelled againſt my word,</hi> and v. 28. <hi>Aaron dyed there in the top of the mountaine,</hi> and Ch. 27. v. 13. <hi>God ſayd to Moſes, when thou haſt ſeen</hi> (the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) <hi>thou allſo shall be gathered vnto thy people as Aaron thy Brother was gathered: For ye rebelled againſt my commandment.</hi> Thus you ſee theſe two great Saints, both puniſhed with a moſt ſpeedy death: For that very ſin, of which they, being admonis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59494:96"/> by God himſelf, queſtionleſſe did repent. Whence after this ſin committed God did ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converſe with Moſes, from ch. 20. to 27. By all theſe, and a world of other ſuch examples, it is made evident, that upon the true repentance of the delinquent, though the pain of eternall death be allwayes forgiven him, yet often the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent remaines liable to ſuffer temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: even as in this world, though upon the repentance of a delinquent deſerving death, the puniſhment of death be forgiven him, yet he is juſtly made liable to ſuffer impriſonment, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to pay ſuch a fine.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Out of this principle it clearly followeth that there is a Purgatory; for ſeeing that a man may dye before he hath ſuffered, or ſatisfyed for the puniſhment due by divine Iuſtice unto him, it doth neceſſarily follow, that this puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame Iuſtice, muſt be given him in the world to come; not in hell, becauſe the ſin is forgiven him: but yet in the priſon of Purgatory, out of which he ſhall not go, untill he hath paid the laſt farthing, Matth. 5.26. It remains then proved, that this principle, (ſo well grounded in Scripture) cannot be true, unleſſe it allſo be true, that there is a Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I paſſe to the ſecond principle, teaching that ſome ſins are only veniall, deſerving indeed ſome puniſhment, but not eternall. For as he were <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59494:96"/> a Tyrant, who would puniſh every offence (though it deſerves but whipping) with a cruell death, ſo we ſhould have too too hard opinion of Gods Iuſtice, if we believed, that for every merry lye, for every idle word, or paſſionate ſpeech, for every trifling away of a ſmall time unprofitably, for every vain or lazy action, he ſhould puniſh the delinquent with death everlaſting, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unſpeakable torments of Hell fire, if the perſon dyeth without repentance, as thouſands muſt needs do, who dye ſuddenly or out of theyr ſenſes, or in theyr ſleep, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That there be ſuch veniall ſins, or ſmaller offences, as theſe are, which be truly ſins yet not mortall or damnable is clear out of Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 1.17. <hi>But the Midwives</hi> (of Egypt)
<hi>feared God, and preſerved the men Children,</hi> contrary to the command of the King; who queſtioning them for breaking his commandment, they anſwered; <hi>The Hebrew weomen are not as the Egyptian weomen; for they have the knowledg to play the Midwife themſelves and before we come to them they are delivered. God the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore did well to the Midwives; and becauſe they feared God, be built them houſes:</hi> Here you ſhee the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives telling an officious lye, which is a ſin; yet this ſin did not take from them the love of God, or made God hate them: but they even then <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God,</hi> as the Scripture ſayth, and he for this theyr fear, (exerciſed not in this lye, but in theyr <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59494:97"/> Charity and Mercy,) highly rewarded them. Yet this lying being a ſin, divine Iuſtice could not but reſerve ſome puniſhment for it, though not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Even ſo Ioſue 2.2. The ſpies ſent by Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue entred the houſe of Rahab. <hi>And it was told the King of Iericho. He ſent to Rahab ſaying; bring forth the men that came to the, for they be ſpies: and the woman taking the men, hid them and ſayd, I confeſſe they came to me, when the gate was a shutting in the dark: and they withall went out; I know not whither they be gone perſue quickly, and you shall overtake them. But she made the men go up to the roof of her houſe, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with the ſtalk of flax which was there.</hi> Here you have another officious lye, but only a veniall, not a damnable ſin. By lying ſhe ſinned venially, but by that act of charitably hiding the ſpies, ſhe pleaſed God: For S. Paul ſayth, <hi>by Faith Rahab. perished not, receiving the ſpies with peace,</hi> Hebr. 11. 31. And S. Iames chap. 2. v. 25. <hi>Rahab, was she not juſtifyed by works, receiving the Meſſengers and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them forth another way, after that she had firſt hid them?</hi> Of theſe kind of veniall ſins the Scripture allſo ſayth. <hi>Seven times shall the juſt fall and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Prov. 24.16. For, theſe ſmaller ſins caſt us not out of Gods favour; wherefore by his grace, we ſoon get pardon again. And hence theſe ſins are called veniall; ſuch as eaſily have pardon.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whence our Saviour himſelf doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59494:97"/> ſeverall ſins, and affirms ſome of them to deſerve puniſhment, but not hell fire. Matth. 5. v. 22. <hi>Whoſoever is angry</hi> (for ſo the Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles read it) <hi>with his Brother, shall be in danger of Iudgment. And whoſoever shall ſay to his Brother Raca, shall be in danger of Councill. And whoſoever shall ſay, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</hi> Of which only eternall puniſhment, the two former ſins did not endanger us, they being but veniall. Hence it is evident, that there be ſome ſins, which God jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth worthy of puniſhment, and yet not to deſerve <hi>hell fire:</hi> and he ſpeaks of the puniſhment of the next life, as of hell, &amp;c. Again, Matth. 12.36.
<hi>I ſay unto you that every idle word that man shall ſpeak, he shall render an account therof in the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The words of leſſer anger deſerved not hell fire as the former Text taught us; yet they being worſe then meer idle words, ſome puniſhment is due to them. For here this Text ſayth, <hi>ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be rendred even for every idle word.</hi> But a leſſer account then for angry words, and therefore they will not alone make us liable to hell fire. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Matth. 7.3. ſome ſins be called <hi>Beams,</hi> ſome only <hi>Mothes;</hi> which name Chriſt (hating deadly ſin to death) would never give to any ſin, that were damnable. Neither would he (if theſe leſſer ſins were damnable) ſpeak of them as he doth, Matth. 23. v. 24. <hi>You tithe Mint and Aniſe &amp;c blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de guides, that ſtrain a gnat, and ſwallow a Camel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59494:98"/> ſome ſins only like <hi>gnats,</hi> and the doing of them compared to the fault, that would be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>te pay Tythe for Mint and Aniſe,</hi> Yet becauſe all veniall ſins do ſomething pollute the ſoule this ſtain muſt be purged or cleanſed. Often this is not done in this world; for we ſee dayly men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew in doing theſe ſins to the laſt, looſing all ſenſe, and life allſo, before they repent them: ſome account then in Iudgment (following after death immediately) will be given of them. Not in Hell, for they deſerve it not: therefore in Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Agreable to this is that which our Saviour ſayth Luke 12.47. <hi>That ſervant who knoweth the will of his Lord, and doth not according to his will, shall be beaten with many ſtripes: but he that knoweth it not, and doth things worthy of ſtripes, shall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> Hence it is evident, that there be ſome men, who do things worthy of ſtripes, which they ſhall not eſcape; but yet <hi>they shall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> But if theſe ſtripes be to be laid on for all eternity (as all ſtripes be, which are paid in Hell) they will not be few; becauſe being everlaſting, the number of them will be without number: will then any one call theſe ſtripes few? Or can any man perſwade himſelf, that a God, who is all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, will, in this unmercifull manner, puniſh the ſpeaking of one idle word? Yet Chriſt himſelf ſayth, that we ſhall be accountable <hi>for every idle word we ſpeak,</hi> Matth. 12. Wherefore we muſt be <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59494:98"/> lyable to ſome puniſhment for every idle word: ſo that if a man of full age converted from Idolatry, be baptized, and by and by after killed, before he commit any other ſin, then the ſpeaking of one idle word only; ſhall this man be tormented for ever and ever, ſo long as God ſhall be God? And ſhall the Father of mercies give this unmercifull ſentence? Doubtleſſe if any man can do a thing
<hi>worthy of ſtripes,</hi> and for doing it, deſerve only to be beaten with few ſtripes, this man may hope for this mercy. But for greater then this he cannot hope; ſeeing that Chriſt ſayth, that ſome account is to be given for that idle word. Some puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore he muſt ſuffer, but not eternall; and conſequently not in Hell, but in Purgatory. For he muſt be beaten with few ſtripes, not with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſny, or everlaſting ſtripes. If this principle (ſo well grounded in Scripture) be true, then it cannot but be true, that there is a Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>The third principle,</hi> clearly allſo contained in Scripture is, that prayer may profitably be made for the dead. This is proved, as well out of the old as new Teſtament. In the old Teſtament, 2. Mach. 12. where after diverſe of the ſouldiers of Iudas Machabeus had been ſlain in the Battle, v. 43. <hi>He making a gathering ſent twelve thouſand drachmes of ſilver to Hieruſalem to have Sacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the ſins,</hi> (of the dead) <hi>well and religiouſly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the reſurrection. For unleſſe he hoped that they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59494:99"/> who were ſlain should riſe again, it should ſeem ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and vain to pray for the dead. It is therefore a holy and healthfull cogitation to pray for the dead, that they may be looſed from theyr ſins.</hi> Your Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſo mangle the ſenſe here, that I would not follow them.</p>
               <p>I know Proteſtants will ſay theſe Books be not Canonicall, though in the <hi>third Councel of Carthage</hi> Can. 47. They be regiſtred in the Canon. Yet not to diſpute this matter, I take that which is granted without all diſpute; that is, that theſe Books be writen by a true and faithfull writer of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church Hiſtory: or elſe why do you place them in the Bible? And without diſpute allſo they were written before our Saviours time. So that by the moſt grave teſtimony of ſo antient a writer of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, we have, firſt that Iudas Machabeus, who then was High Prieſt, and allſo chief commander of the Iewes, (Gods only true people) did hold prayer for the dead to be lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Secondly, that this was not his private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but a thing done confirmably to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the Iewiſh Church, which to this very day uſes prayer for the dead; Thirdly, all the ſouldiers being men, who had devoted theyr lives for the defence of the true belief, concurred, by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to this act of Piety,
<hi>That Sacrifice might be offered for the dead.</hi> Fourthly the Prieſts of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, who beſt knew theyr Churches cuſtome in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59494:99"/> Sacrifices for the dead (which were the ſame that for ſin) are never ſayd to have ſcrupulized at the matter. Fifthly, this moſt ancient Hiſtorian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends this cuſtome as holy. All theſe things not being ſingular in thoſe men alone, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening not full two hundred yeares before Chriſt, and ſtill laſting to this day among the Iewes, there could not but be many, who practiſed this (ſo commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thing) in his and his Apoſtles times. And yet you never read the leaſt reprehenſion given them for it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Out of the new Teſtament we have two places: Firſt S. Paul, 1. Cor. 15.29. <hi>What shall they do, who are baptized for the dead? if the dead do not riſe att all, to what end are they baptized for them?</hi> As if he would ſay, to what end do men do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the dead? To what end is this done, if there be no reſurrection, and the ſoule do not ſtill ſurvive expecting to be reunited to the body? S. Paul can ſpeak here of no other baptiſme which can profit the dead, but the baptiſme of pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; for ſo S. Marke, and ſo S. Luke ſpeaks. And certain it is, that S. Paul takes his argument from that, which with profit to the dead, can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for them. Otherwiſe when he preſſeth ſo hotty thoſe words, <hi>To what end are they baptized for them?</hi> one might eaſily anſwer, to no end. True then it is, that to a very good end we undertake this painfull Baptiſme of Pennance for the dead, <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59494:100"/> ſo taking upon us part of theyr fiery Baptiſme in Purgatory. This is the language of Holy Fathers, expounding Scripture, as Bellarmin ſheweth (l. 1. de Purgatorio cap. 4.) out of S. Hierome, S. Baſil, and Bede, all expounding thoſe words, <hi>He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi> Matth. 3. <hi>That is</hi> (ſay they) <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt shall he baptize in this world, and with fire in the world to come.</hi> To the ſame effect he cites S. Gregory Naz. calling Purgatory fire the <hi>laſt Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. The ſecond text is 1. Io. 5.16. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother to ſin a ſin not to death, let him aske, and life shall be given for them that ſin not to death.</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is a ſin to death (committed by irrepentent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it. And ſo we never pray for thoſe, whom we know to dy unrepentant. This is the true ſenſe of this place, and hence it is clear, that there <hi>be ſins to death,</hi> and <hi>ſins not to death.</hi> The meaning is not, that there be ſins mortall, and ſins veniall, neither according to our interpreters, or according to yours, who deny all veniall ſins. As for us we all hold prayer lawfully and fruitfully made for any ſin whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver during the life of the ſinner. Wherefore <hi>a ſin to death, is to leave faith, working by Charity even to death.</hi> As S. Auſtin ſayth, de Correp. &amp; gra. c. 12. Whence it followeth contrariwiſe, that <hi>a ſin not to death,</hi> is that which a man commiteth, but doth not perſever in it untill he be dead. S. Iohn the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59494:100"/> encourageth us with confidence to pray for any, whom we do not know to be departed in deadly ſin unrepented. For it is evident that S. Iohn ſpeaks here of praying for the dead. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe before the death of any ſinner, we may pray for pardon of his ſins, whatſoever they be, and our prayer may be heard. But S. Iohn ſpeaks of a ſinner now placed in ſuch a ſtate, that prayer for him will not be available. Therefore he ſpeaks of praying for ſinners who are dead. And of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſome are dead in theyr ſins without repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. For theſe he bids us not pray. Others of them are dead after they duly repented theyr ſins; and for theſe he encourageth us to pray. I prove this <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of theyr prayer, <hi>who know theyr brother to ſin not to death,</hi> that is, to have given ſignes of true repentance. <hi>For any ſuch let him aske, and life</hi> (of glory)
<hi>shall be given him, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not to death.</hi> Now if this principle of praying for the dead be true, it cannot but be true, that there is a Purgatory, ſeeing that prayer brings no relief to any, that are either in heaven or Hell.</p>
               <p n="18">18. To theſe <hi>three principles,</hi> we may yet add ſeverall Texts, to the ſame effect, as Apocal. 21. v. 27. <hi>There shall in no wiſe enter into it</hi> (heaven) <hi>any thing that defileth.</hi> Many dy polluted with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of veniall ſins unrepented. This pollution muſt be purged before they enter heaven. Many allſo dye before they have fully ſatisfied for all <pb n="188" facs="tcp:59494:101"/> pain, due to theyr mortall ſins forgiven them. This full ſatisfaction muſt be made, before they enter heaven. But where? In that priſon, of which it is ſayd, Matth. 5. v.
27. <hi>Amen, I ſay unto you, thou shalt not go out from thence, untill thou payeſt the laſt farthing.</hi> Vpon which place, S. Hierome. <hi>This is that which he ſayth, thou shalt not go out of priſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou shalt pay even to thy litle ſins:</hi> And ſo S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. Now that after the paying of the laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there is going out, and forgiveneſſe in the world to come, Chriſt himſelf doth teach, Matth. 12. v. 32. ſaying,
<hi>It shall not be forgiven the, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> For it is non ſenſe to ſay, <hi>I will neither marry in this world, nor in the world to come;</hi> becauſe in that world there is no marrying; the like non ſenſe would be in Chriſts words, if there were no forgiveneſſe in the next world. I conclude with S. Paul 1. Cor. 3. v. 15.
<hi>If any mans work shall be burnt) as wood hay, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> will do (by which leſſer ſins are ſignified) he ſhall ſuffer loſſe.
<hi>But he himſelf shall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> Which S. Ambroſe Serm. 20. in Pſalm. 118. expounds thus, <hi>Wheras S. Paul ſayth, yet ſo as by fire, he sheweth indeed that he shall be ſaved, but yet shall ſuffer the punishment of fire; that being purged by fire, he may be ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not tormented for ever, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are, by everlaſting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. All theſe proofes we have out of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, though they be ſo little noted by our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59494:101"/> who dayly read Scripture. Yet they are to know, that if they will do what the pretend, they ſhould, by clear Scripture (before they deny Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory) ſhew us manifeſtly, <hi>that there is no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> For theyr prime pretence of juſt ſeparation from us, is, that they were inforced thereunto, for ſuch errours, as they can manifeſtly <hi>by only Scripture</hi> demonſtrate to be damnable. Let them ſhew this of Purgatory, and we have done.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XXVI. POINT.</hi> Of Indulgences.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TO underſtand this point well, which is miſunderſtood by a world of people, <hi>note firſt</hi> what we proved in the former point, that full often, after that God hath pardoned the guilt of ſinne, he doth not pardon the guilt of all that pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to which the ſinner, according to Iuſtice, is ſtill lyable for the ſin forgiven. <hi>Note ſecondly:</hi> that we are moſt groſsly belyed by our adverſaries who ſay that our doctrine is, <hi>that the Pope can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins by graunting Indulgences unto us,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas no Catholicke Doctor can ever be ſhewed to have taught this doctrine. We all unanimouſly teach that <hi>the Pope by no Indulgence can forgive any one ſingle mortall or veniall ſin.</hi> For our Faith tells us that thoſe ſins are onely forgiven us by true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59494:102"/> or due ſorrow in the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, joyned allwayes with a ſincere purpoſe of offending no more. That which is forgiven by an Indulgence is not the guilt of any ſin, either mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or veniall; but <hi>it is only the pardoning of part, or of all that paine,</hi> which yet (according to Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) we ſtand lyable to pay for the ſins already forgiven. Neither doth any Catholicke Doctor teach that the Pope can forgive any ſinner this paine at his pleaſure, by graunting him a Plenary Indulgence. But, if our doctrine be truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we all require more for gaining pardon, even of the leaſt part of the paine (ſtill due to our very leaſt ſins) then Proteſtants require to the full forgivenes of all the greateſt ſins that are, or can be, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all togeather with all the paine which can be due unto them, which is a point exceedingly to be noted it being apparently true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the firſt thing which we require to gain any part, even of the leaſt Indulgence, is to have true faith producing true repentance for our ſin. This alone with Proteſtants ſuffices to remit the guilt of all ſins whatſoever and all paines due to all ſins of which any man can be guilty. Doth it do ſo with us? No, it is farre from it. We ſay that after this, <hi>firſt</hi> he muſt make a true entire Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> He muſt moreover ſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to make perfect reſtitution of any thing to which hs is bound. <hi>Thirdly</hi> he ſtands obliged to <pb n="191" facs="tcp:59494:102"/> performe the Pennance enjoyned him. <hi>Fourthly</hi> if this pennance fall ſhort of ſatisfying the divine Iuſtice for the paines yet due to the ſins forgiven; the ſinner ſtands ſtill obliged to ſatisfie the divine Iuſtice by other penall works. Now all that we ſay is, that this paine may be pardoned him by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; though not by Indulgences graunted meerly at the Popes pleaſure; but by Indulgences graunted by him upon ſufficient cauſes, which cauſes he muſt carefully examine. And after the graunt of Indulgences (upon due cauſes) you muſt not thinke any thing is done untill we, on our parts, have done what is required. What is that? It is, that after ſuch humble Repentance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch an entire Confeſſion, and reſtitution, as I ſayd, we performe the things expreſſed in the Graunt of the Indulgence. And when all is done, the moſt, that we obtaine, is to have pardon due to ſuch ſins the guilt of which is allready forgiven by our repentance and Confeſſion. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teach that Faith alone quite frees men for ever of all theyr ſins, and of all the <hi>paine</hi> that was due for theyr ſins though never ſo many or ſo great: for after this faith God imputes theyr ſins no longer to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Before I prove that the Pope hath power by Indulgences, graunted upon juſt cauſe, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch as duely performe what is enjoyned, I further note, that the Blood of Chriſt was of that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59494:103"/> infinite value, that the ſhedding of one droppe thereof was able to ſatisfie divine Iuſtice for all the ſins of the world, yea of a million of worlds, and able to ſatisfie alſo for all the paine that could be due for all thoſe ſins: Wherefore, ſeeing Chriſt did not ſhed his blood for us by dropps, but by ſhowers; hence it followeth evidently that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of Chriſt alone be, in a moſt high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſuperaboundant. Tell me now, is the moſt precious treaſure of all this ſuperaboundancy of ſatisfactions, in order to cancell the paine due to our ſins, ſo wholy loſt, that, even the liveing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts body can receive no benefit by this ſuperaboundancy? God forbid. They be not treaſures wrapped up in a napkin. Wherefore there muſt be a power on earth to diſpenſe this rich treaſure, but yet to diſpenſe it ſo, as becoms a prudent diſpenſer of the myſteries of God. Now, who is the higheſt and chiefeſt in this dignity of diſpenſing, but he, whome we have proved to be the head and chief Paſtour of Chriſts Church, to whome it was ſayd. <hi>To thee I will give the Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Matth. 16. v. 19. <hi>Feede my sheepe</hi> Io 21. v, 15. See the ſeventh Point.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That ſuch Indulgences as here deſcribed, may be graunted, I prove <hi>firſt</hi> becauſe to give thus <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdome of heaven</hi> to S. Peter and to his ſucceſſours (as is there proved) is to give power of removing any barr that may ſhutt us
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59494:103"/> out of heaven, whether this barr be the ſin it ſelfe which excludes us eternally (if not removed) or whether it be the guilt of paine, for our ſins forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which excludeth us onely untill ſuch time as due ſatisfaction is made for that paine. Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be made for this paine either by our ſelves, performing ſufficiently for this effect ſuch ſatisfactory workes as we ſpake of Point 9. and 24. Or which may be performed for us by others. For, as I may pay my debts by my ſelfe, ſo I may pay them by a friend.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the proofe of this is a <hi>ſecond proofe</hi> of Indulgences out of Col. 1.24. <hi>I Paul, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in ſuffering for you, and doe accomplish thoſe things which want of the Paſsion of Chriſt in my flesh, for his body which is the Church.</hi> Of which Text ſee what I ſayd Point 24. n. 6. whence appeares that notwithſtanding the fullnes and ſuperabondance of Chriſts Paſſion in it ſelfe; yet in order to our being made compleatly partakers of ſeverall fruits thereof, ſomething may be (and often is) wanting on our part. What is this? It is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of thoſe ſatisfactory workes, which (in that Point) we have at large ſhewed Chriſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at our hands. And, untill ſuch workes be performed, either by us in perſon, or for us in the perſon of ſome other, we ſtill ſtand lyable to the paine due to our ſins forgiven. Now that an other may offer ſuch workes for us, is made evident by <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59494:104"/> the text we cited out of S. Paul, affirming that he rejoyced in doeing this deed of charity, which conſiſted in ſuffering (that is in doeing a worke moſt ſatisfactory) for them and by it <hi>to make up or to accomplish in his flesh that which was yet behind or as yet wanted of the Paſsion of Chriſt:</hi> that is, what <hi>was wanting,</hi> not on Chriſts part but on the part o his body, which is the Church. Now as S. Paul (as then confirmed in grace) had few ſins, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſufferings, which he could well ſpare, and give away to pay his brothers debt; ſo had S. Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, ſo had our Lady; ſo the Apoſtles, ſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs and many others. But above all Chriſts ſufferings alone had an inexhauſtable ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance which ſufferings, although Chriſt, by his ordinary courſe of providence doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie to the full cleanſing of our ſins, and of the paine due to our ſins; unleſſe we doe what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our part: yet he hath left power to his Vicar on earth, upon juſt cauſes and with due circumſpection to impart (by way of ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Indulgence) thoſe ſuperabundant ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of Chriſt and his Saints unto us, that, by this ſuperabondancy, our wants may be ſupplied, if we duely diſpoſe our ſelves by his grace to be partakers of that great favour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>A third proofe</hi> of Indulgences out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is to ſhew S. Paul exerciſing in the perſon of Chriſt this ſpeciall favour or Indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="195" facs="tcp:59494:104"/> the inceſtous Corinthian. Whome (in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians) he had given over to Satan by Excommunication. But afterwards moved to be more favorable unto him by his great repentance, he doth not onely abſolue him from from the ſin, and from the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but having enjoyned him a moſt ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke pennance (which was to have laſted for a great time before the paines due to his enormious offence would have been fully cancelled) he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding out of the plenitude of his Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power gratiouſly pardons the remnant of his pennance. Now this pardon would have been no favour nor grace, unles, at the ſame time, he had pardoned the remnant of the paine ſtill due, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine Iuſtice. Therefore he declares expreſſely, that he doth it in the power of Chriſt; ſo he ſayth 2. Cor. 2. v. 10. <hi>To whom you forgive any thing I forgive allſo in the perſon of Chriſt:</hi> that is, by Chriſts commiſſion I give this pardon, Chriſt ratifying the pardon or Indulgence which I give, to one ſo well diſpoſed, as I ſee this delinquent to be.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce comes in a <hi>fourth proof</hi> Io. 20. v.
23. <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins you shall remitt, they are forgiven, and whoſe ſins you shall retaine, the are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> Behold power in the Church not only to forgive the remnant of the paine due to the ſins forgiven, (which is all that is done by Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,)
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59494:105"/> but allſo behold a power to forgive the very ſin it ſelfe, and conſequently to take quite away the very eternity of paine, which before was due to the ſin. See Point 16. Whence you cannot wonder to ſee power of taking away only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paine due to ſin, when ſuch conditions be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, as wee did expreſſe here, n. 2.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XXVII. POINT.</hi> That faith alone doth not Iuſtifie.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THis is a point, point blank, againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prime Point of Proteſtant Religion as theyr grand Reformers call it, who define this faith to be, <hi>an aſſured confidence that theyr ſins are forgiven them wholy by Chriſts Paſsion:</hi> And yet in all Scripture they will not find one ſingle text to prove, that ever yet, any one ſingle man, was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this ſpeciall faith (as they call it) I ſay, <hi>by this ſpeciall Faith,</hi> which breeds in them an aſſured confidence, that theyr ſins in particular are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them for Chriſts ſake. Wee aske only for one ſuch Text: And yet though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of this the Proteſtant beliefe, be chiefly grounded in this Point, they have not ſo much as one ſimple cleere Text; ſo groundles is theyr very ground. Look upon the Faith of Abraham, who is called <hi>the Father of all that believe,</hi> and ſee what <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59494:105"/> Faith <hi>was counted to him, for his righteouſnes.</hi> Rom. 4.3. and you ſhall find that verſe taken out Gen.
15. v. 6. where, when God had told him <hi>he would multiply his ſeed like the ſtarres, Abraham believed God, and he counted it to him for righteouſnes.</hi> Why ſo? For his believing promptly that which God had revealed in a matter ſo hard to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as is expreſly ſayd Rom. 4.21.22. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I argue thus: Here is no mention of his aſſured confidence that his ſins were forgiven him by Chriſts Paſſion, but here is mention of Iuſtifying Faith, or of <hi>Faith counted or imputed to man for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,</hi> therefore Iuſtifying Faith is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as this ſpeciall Faith, or confidence. How this Faith of Abraham came to Iuſtify, S. Iames tels us, that it was by being a Faith effective of good works. For he ſo firmely believed what God had ſaid, that he feared not to ſee that ſaying made null, and voyd, though he ſhould offer upon the Altar that very Sonne of his, upon whom, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, all Gods faire promiſes ſeemed grounded.
<hi>For was not Abraham our Father juſtifyed by works, when he had offered Iſaac his Son upon the Altar?</hi> Iam. 2.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee ſay then, that Faith alone doth not juſtify, but that Faith, working by Charity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats Iuſtification. Luke 7.47.
<hi>Many ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her becauſe shee loved much.</hi> So Matth. 22. v. 11. Hee that was called to the marriage Feaſt, and came to it, and entred in, and ſat down, could not <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59494:106"/> do this but by faith entring the Church, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he was not attired in a wedding garment</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he was caſt out, and for his ſake it was ſayd;
<hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. S. Paul allſo inculcates this 1. Cor. 13.2. <hi>If I ſhould have all Faith, ſo that I should move moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and have no Charity, I am nothing</hi> Note the word <hi>all Faith.</hi> Again v. 13.
<hi>The greater of theſe three, is Charity.</hi> And again, Col. 3.14.
<hi>But above all things have Charity, which is the bond of perfection.</hi> For Matth. 22. v. 40. <hi>On theſe two Commandements</hi> (of Charity)
<hi>dependeth the whole Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Yet again Gal. 5.6.
<hi>Neither Circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Charity, or love.</hi> Behold that very Faith, which our very doctrine requires, that is, <hi>(Faith working by Charity)</hi> which allſo before he called, <hi>Faith obſerving the Commandements of God.</hi> 1. Cor.
7.19. Where it is ſayd, <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God.</hi> Again, Gal.
6.15. <hi>Neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, nor incircumciſion, but a new Creature,</hi> formed by Charity, according to Gods commandements. Again, Eph 1 4. <hi>He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us before the conſtitution of the world, that wee should be Holy and without blame, before him in love, or Charity.</hi> Note how that which makes us <hi>Holy, and without blame before him, is Charity</hi> Again Eph. 3 17. <hi>Chriſt dwels by Faith in the hart, rooted in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> 
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59494:106"/> Again, Hebr. 5.9. <hi>He became the author of eternall ſaluation to all that obey him.</hi> He was not made the author of this ſaluation to any but ſuch as did <hi>obey him.</hi> For as is ſayd, 1. Io. 1.7. <hi>If we walke in the light</hi> (Lex Lux) <hi>the blood of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Where read you that it doth ſo, <hi>if wee walke not in the light, or do not obey him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Note, that beſides other Texts, I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here
<hi>eight</hi> out of S. Paul, becauſe our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries chiefly ground themſelves, in thoſe his words, Rom. 3.28. <hi>A man is juſtifyed by Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works of the Law.</hi> Where his meaning only is, that neither the works <hi>of the written Law,</hi> done by the Iew, nor the works
<hi>of the Law of nature,</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the Gentil, (before either of them believe in Chriſt) can, (without Faith in Chriſt) juſtify any one. For neither Iew nor Gentil is juſtifyed by any one of thoſe works; but they are juſtifyed by that Faith, which he told you in the former Texts, to <hi>worke by Charity,</hi> and to be a <hi>Faith obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the commandments of God, making us a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rooted in Charity, and obeying him.</hi> Thus S. Paul is explicated by S. Aug. upon this place. Yea he is explicated by S. Iames in many places of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter, as v. 14. <hi>Though a man, ſayth he, hath Faith, and have not works, can Faith ſave him?</hi> Note here firſt that S. Iames ſuppoſeth this may happen, that <hi>a man may have Faith, but not works,</hi> and that, in this caſe, <hi>his Faith will not ſave him,</hi> which is <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59494:107"/> that which S. Paul allſo ſayd before. <hi>If I have all Faith but have not Charity, I am nothing.</hi> S. Iames goes on v. 21. <hi>Abraham was he not juſtifyed by works, offering Iſaac? Seeſt thou not, how Faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.</hi> If this Faith had juſtifyed before any works proceeded from it, it had been perfected before any ſuch works Yet it is ſayd, <hi>that by works this Faith was made perfect.</hi> Whence followeth v.
24. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by works a man is juſtifyed, and not by Faith only.</hi> This then is our demonſtration; if Faith juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth alone, it juſtifyeth without works, but S. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſayth it doth not juſtify without works, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it doth not juſtify alone. <hi>For by works, and not by Faith alone a man is juſtifyed.</hi> What more cleer?</p>

                  <hi>THE XXVIII. POINT.</hi> VVhether our Iuſtification be any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us.</head>
               <p n="1">1. OVr adverſaries doctrine is, that wee are only juſt, becauſe God is pleaſed to repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te us ſo, in regard of Chriſts Iuſtice imputed to us, and thus he doth only cover our ſins, theſe ſins ſtill remaining in vs, but God doth now impute them to us, becauſe, wee having once layd hold of Chriſts Iuſtice by the hands of Faith, this Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59494:107"/> is made ours, and by Chriſts merits wee ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtly be ſaved.

For, as was ſayd in the former Texts, wee have in us <hi>a new hart, a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by Charity, powred forth in our very harts,</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us inwardly
<hi>into new creatures, and new men</hi> being truly <hi>renewed in ſpirit.</hi> Whence 1. Io. 3. <hi>Wee are not only called the Sons of God,</hi> v. 1. But, <hi>now wee are the ſons of God,</hi> v. 2. So when you read that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams Fai h, working by Charity, was <hi>imputed to him to righteouſnes, and he was called the friend of God</hi> Iames 2.23. You ſhall note that he therefore was reputed juſt, and therefore called the friend of God, becauſe truly he <hi>was juſt,</hi> and was truly <hi>Gods friend,</hi> having Faith quickned by Charity in him. So Luke 1.6. of Zachary and Elizabeth. <hi>They were both righteous before God,</hi> (whoſe eyes ſee what is the moſt covered) <hi>walking in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and Ordinances of our Lord without bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi> They therefore were juſt, even
<hi>before Gods eyes.</hi> And this true Iuſtice in the eyes of God, is, in the ſame chapter, promiſed to vs, by the grace of the Saviour there foretold, <hi>that wee may ſerve him in Holynes, righteouſnes, and Iuſtice before him all our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> v. 75. Note this Holynes <hi>before him,</hi> which is to <hi>be Holy in his ſight.</hi> Hence God to Noë, Gen. 7.1. <hi>I have ſeen thy righteouſnes before me.</hi> Hence allſo Col. 1.10. <hi>That you may walke worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing, fructifying in all good works. Giving thanks to the Father who hath made us meet to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takere <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59494:108"/> of the inheritance of the Saints</hi> So Apoc. 3.4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled theyr garments, and they shall walk with me in whites, becauſe they be worthy.</hi> And 1. Io. 3.7. <hi>Litle Children let no man deceive you. He hath doth righteouſnes, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi> Note thoſe words, <hi>even as he</hi> (that is God) <hi>is righteous.</hi> For God is righteous not by imputative, but true interior Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of which inward Iuſtice Chriſt ſayth Matth. 5.20. <hi>I ſay unto you, unles your righteouſnes shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thae of Scribes and Phariſees, you shall not entee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> For if there be not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in us, exceeding Scribes and Phariſees, wee ſhall be damned, and no righteouſnes ſhall be imputed to us. For as is ſayd Rom. 2.2. <hi>Wee are ſure that the judgement of God is according to truth.</hi> It were not verity but falſity to repute him juſt, who in very truth is not juſt, but is ſtill a ſinner. Hence Prov. 17. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>He that juſtifyeth the impious, and he that condemneth the Iuſt, both are abominable before God.</hi> Dare you ſay that God doth that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable? He reputes things to be as they truly are in themſelves. So Rom. 2.9 <hi>Wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tribulation and Anguish upon every ſoule of man that worketh evill.</hi> He imputes Iuſtice to no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, untill he leaves of to be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by true returning to works of Iuſtice. Thoſe whom he reputes clean, truly are clean. <hi>And you are clean.</hi> Io. 13.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly</hi> hence wee ſay that our ſins be not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59494:109"/> only covered, but wholy taken away. For wee by vertue of Gods inward grace given for Chriſt, are clenſed, made white, and glittering. For <hi>Chriſt is the Lambe of God who taketh away the ſins of the world</hi> Io. 1.29. He doth not only cover them, but takes them quite away. And ſo Pſal. 32.2. when David ſayth, <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute iniquity, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>there is no guile in his ſpirit.</hi> And becauſe <hi>there is no guile,</hi> therefore no iniquity can be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Proteſtants ſtill cite the former words, but leave out theſe latter, which words teach us excellently, that that which is covered from Gods eyes, muſt not be at all, and therefore his ſin now not being at all, cannot now at all be ſeen, For as the ſame David tells you, Pſal. 103 v. 12. <hi>As farre as the eaſt is diſtant from the Weſt, ſo farre hath he removed our tranſgreſsions from us.</hi> This expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it may be thought very full, yet really our ſins forgiven, are as farre from us, as that which is not now, is diſtant from that which is now, which is a greater diſtance
<hi>then Eaſt from Weſt,</hi> though that be farre enough to declare a true perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by quite aboliſhing the ſin forgiven by infuſed grace, according to Ezech. 36.25. <hi>I will ſprincle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your filthines.</hi> And 1. Io 1.7. <hi>And the blood of Chriſt clenſeth us from all ſin.</hi> So that by this his blood
<hi>the body of ſin is deſtroyed.</hi> Rom. 6.6. And thus, <hi>he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59494:109"/> will caſt all our ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi> Mich. 7.19.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>THe hart is deceitfull above all things, who can know it?</hi> Ier. 17.9. Yet Proteſtants placing juſtification in ſuch a ſpeciall faith, as aſſures each man of his ſaluation by the merits of Chriſt, are hence enforced to teach <hi>two ſtrange Paradoxes.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> conformably to all the Texts wee ſay, that thoſe who were juſt, may come finally to be damned. For exod.
32.33 <hi>Whoſoever hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt mee, him will I blot out of my Book.</hi> Thoſe who are baptized, are <hi>born again of water and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Io. 3.5.

Salomon his ſaluation is much doubted of by Holy Fathers, yet there could be no doubt the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, if your opinion were true; for God himſelf ſayth, he once was juſt. 1.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59494:110"/> and Iudgements as at this day.</hi> At <hi>that day</hi> then he was in a ſtate pleaſing to God and yet you ſee doubt of his perſeverance is even here intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yea, by and by David his Father tells him; <hi>but if you forſake him, he will caſt the of for ever.</hi> v. 9. David did not judge Salomon to be at this time out of Gods favour, yet his words ſhew he feared that he might hereafter come to looſe Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. What Salomon after did, the Scripture tels us. 1. Kings 11. v. 3. <hi>Weomen turned away his hart. And when he was now old, his wives turned away his hart to other Gods. He worshiped Aſtarthee the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of the Sidonians, and Moloch the Idol of the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, he built a Temple to Camos the Idol of Moab, and in this manner he did to all his wives, who where ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Therefore our Lord was angry with Salomon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heart was turned from the Lord.</hi> v. 9. Did he not ceaſe to be juſt, when <hi>his heart was turned away from our Lord?</hi> David ſayth Pſal. 5.7. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> God then <hi>did hate Salomon.</hi> I diſpute not whether he repented or no, whether he were ſaved or no; but without all diſpute, he once loſt his former Iuſtice, <hi>his hart and minde being turned away from God, and our Lord therefore bearing wrath againſt him,</hi> and hating him. Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtles Act. 6.3. <hi>Commanded ſeaven men full of the Holy Ghoſt to be made Deacons.</hi> One of them was <hi>Nicolas a ſtranger of Antioch.</hi> Theſe they <pb n="208" facs="tcp:59494:111"/> ſett in the preſence of the Apoſtles, and praying they impoſed hands upon them.

<hi>the foolish Galatians having begun with the ſpirit, ended with the flesh.</hi> Gal. 3.3. It is therefore ſayd to them. <hi>You did run well who hindred you not to obey the truth?</hi> Gal. 5.7.

Io. 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth.</hi> And Rom. 11.22. <hi>If thou continue in his goodnes, otherwiſe thou allſo shall be cutt of.</hi> And 2.

Neither shall the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be able to live for his righteouſnes in the day that he ſinneth. All his righteouſnes shall not be remembred. But for his iniquity, which he hath committed, he shall dy for it.</hi> He then may <hi>die for iniquity</hi> who once was juſt. Hence he taught his juſt Apoſtles to pray, <hi>Lead us
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59494:111"/> not into temptation,</hi> for feare of falling into it. Let us therefore, when wee have faith, <hi>Hold faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith have made shipwrack.</hi> 1. Tim. 1.19.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XXX. POINT.</hi> To Iuſtification it is neceſſary to keep the Commandements. This is poſsible.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Say firſt that it is poſſible to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements by the helpe, and aſſiſtance of Gods grace, ſufficiently afforded us to that end. Deut. 5. v. 1. <hi>Moyſes called all Iſraël, and ſayd to them, heare Iſraël the ſtatutes which I ſpeake in your eares this day. Learn them, and keep and do them.</hi> And then, in the ſixth verſe, he begins to tell all the ten Commandements, which God would have them
<hi>learn, and keep, and do.</hi> But God will exact of no man to keep, and do that, whieh is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ergo, this by his grace is poſſible. <hi>I will give my Law in theyr bowells. And in theyr heart I will write it.</hi> Ier. 31.33. <hi>The law of God is in his heart, none of his ſteps shall ſtide.</hi> Pſal. 37.31. And Rom. 8.4. <hi>God ſending his Son &amp;c. That the Iuſtification of the Law might be fullfilled in us.</hi> All theſe Texts prove that, by Gods grace, wee my fullfill his Law. And therefore as S. Leo excellently ſayth (Serm. 16. de Paſſione) <pb n="210" facs="tcp:59494:112"/>
                  <hi>Iuſtè Deus inſtat praecepto, qui praecurrit auxilio. God juſtly preſſeth upon us the doing of that, to performance of which, he offereth us his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And becauſe ſome Proteſtants ſay, that <hi>the Commandement of loving God with all our hart and ſoule,</hi> is the Commandement impoſſible to us all in this life, I will ſhew this to be flatly againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For of David, 1. Kings 14.8. it is ſayd. <hi>He kept my Commandements, and followed me in all his hart.</hi> So of Ioſias 2. Kings 23.25. <hi>He returned to our Lord with all his hart, and with all his ſoule, and with all his might.</hi> What more is commanded any were? <hi>With my whole hart have I ſought thee.</hi> Pſal. 119.10. He who hath commanded us to do this, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed grace enabling us to perform his command. Deut.
30.6. <hi>Our Lord thy God will circumciſe thy hart, and the hart of thy ſeed, to love our Lord, thy God, with all thy hart, and with all thy ſoule.</hi> And v. 11. <hi>This Commandement that I command thee, this day, is not farre of. It is not in heaven</hi> (where Proteſtants ſay it ſhall only be fullfilied) <hi>that thou mayſt ſay which of us is able to aſcend to heaven to bring it to us, that wee may hear it, and do it</hi> (as God required in the firſt Text) <hi>neither is it beyond the ſea, that thou shouldeſt ſay, who shall go over the ſea for us, and bring it unto us, that wee may heare it and do it. But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it,</hi> do it (I ſay) by the helpe of my grace, making this poſſible even in <pb n="211" facs="tcp:59494:112"/> the old Law. So Pſalm. 119.55. <hi>I have keept thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And this grace makes this really done and performed farre more in the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. God ſaying Ezech. 36.26. <hi>I will geve you a new hart, and will put within you a new ſpirit, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye shall keep my Iudgements, and do them.</hi> And c. 37. v. 24. <hi>They shall walk in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obſerve my ſtatutes, and do them.</hi> This then can be done. Likewiſe this was done by Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie and Elizabeth Luke 1.6. <hi>They were both righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, walking in all his Commandements, and ordinances of our Lord, blameles, or without blame.</hi> Allſo Matth. 19.20. <hi>The yong man ſayth to him,</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>all theſe have I keept from my youth;</hi> and Mark 10. v. 20. <hi>All theſe things have I obſerved from my youth. And Ieſus beholding him loved him,</hi> which he would not have done, if he had been a lyer in what he ſayd. This yong man then was not a lyer. But he <hi>that ſayth he knoweth God, and keepeth not his Commandements, he is a lyer, and the truth is not in him.</hi> 1. Io. 2.4. For as it is ſayd there, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee do know, that wee know him, if wee keep his Commandements.</hi> Again, Io. 17.6. <hi>And they have keep thy word.</hi> And yet further, 1. Io. 3.22. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wee shall aske, wee shall receive of him, becauſe wee keep his Commandements, and do thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> Again, Apoc. 14.12.
<hi>Here are they that keep the Commandements of God.</hi> It is the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59494:113"/> ſaying of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life keep the Commandements.</hi> Matth. 19.17. Mark 10.20. Luke 10.28. and Io. 14.15. <hi>If you love mee, keep my commandements.</hi> And v. 21.
<hi>He that hath my Commandements and Keeps them, he it is that loveth mee.</hi> They may therefore be keept. Yea Chriſt himſelf, Matth. 11.30.
<hi>My yoke is eaſy, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is light.</hi> For 1. Io. 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God, that wee keep his Commandements. And his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are not grievous.</hi> Note allſo that all the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Texts, which prove keeping of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, in thoſe who are of age, to be neceſſary to our Iuſtification, do prove allſo that they are poſſible to be kept. For no impoſſible thing can be neceſſary to our ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly</hi> then I ſay to all, (who have the uſe of reaſon) keeping of the commandements is neceſſary to ſaluation and conſequently to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This is taught in a number of Texts which I cited, Point 27. to prove that faith alone doth not juſtify, but chiefly requires Charity. And S. Iohn ſayth 1. Io. 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God that wee keep his Commandements.</hi> And Matth. 22. v 40. <hi>On thoſe two Commandements</hi> (of Chriſt) <hi>hang all the Law and Prophets.</hi> Our Iuſtification therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but depend upon thoſe two Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence S. Paul 1. Cor. 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59494:113"/> of the Commandement of God.</hi> So that, if this,
<hi>be nothing,</hi> or a thing impoſſible, all comes to be
<hi>nothing.</hi> Again, what wee cited in the 27. Point n. 4. evidently proves works to be neceſſary to ſaluation. But no works are more neceſſary then thoſe that are commanded, theſe therefore are chiefly neceſſary to juſtification.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WE are fouly ſlandered by thoſe, who make us to teach, that it is in our power to do that which is able to advance us towards heaven; (as if wee ſayd this, without adding, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding)
<hi>that this is in our power only by the help of God, firſt moving, and exciting us; and then lending us his helping hand, even all the while that wee art doing any worke, which can advance us towards heaven.</hi> By this helpe wee ſay our free will is ſtill enabled to do good, or avoyd evill; and that, by this helpe, it is in our power allſo, either to omit our dutie, or to do it, a ſufficiency of this grace being ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foarded us, according to that 2.

               <p n="2">2. Hence Pharao his obduration is aſcribed often to his free will. Exod. 8.15. <hi>And Pharao ſeing this, he hardned his hart.</hi> And 1. Samuel 6.6. <hi>Why do you harden your harts, as Aegypt and Pharao did harden theyr hart.</hi> And ſo David cryeth to us all, <hi>Harden not your harts,</hi> Pſal. 94 8.

By this his power we clenſe our hands, purify our harts clenſe our whole ſelves, wee</hi> (Matth. 12.33.)

               <p n="5">5. How frees will comes to lead us to all our evill, S.

                  <hi>THE XXXII. POINT.</hi> How this free will is ſtill helped with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF God gave vs not allwayes that grace which is of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t force to excite us to the effectuall performance of all the good, which we are bound to do, or to the avoyding of all the evill, which we are bound to avoyd, our free will could neither do the one, nor avoid the other. All the former Texts then, which ſo cleerly prove, that wee, (by Gods helpe) can, (if wee will) do what wee are bound to do, and can avoyd, what wee are bound to avoyd, do conſequently prove, that God allwayes gives ſuch Grace to both effects, as wants nothing of perfect ſufficiency to produce them, but our free conſent. Hence S. Paul thus exhorts us, 2. Cor. 6 1. <hi>We then, as workers togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, beſeech you allſo that you receive not the grace of God in vaine.</hi> Excellently the Rhemiſts u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Text. <hi>It lyeth in mans power and free will to fruſtrate, or to follow this motion, of God,</hi> as this Text plainly proveth, which really is the very ſelfeſame that the Councill of Trent ſayth Seſſ. 6. c. 5. <hi>That by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59494:115"/> Gods exciting, and helping grace we are diſpoſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert our ſelves by freely aſſenting and cooperating to the ſame grace, ſo that God, touching the hart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the H. Ghoſt, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neither void of all action, he receiving that inſpiration, for he receives it ſo, as having in his power to caſt it away.</hi> Neither can he without the grace of God move himſelfe. And therfore it followeth in the fourth Canon; <hi>If any one shall ſay that the free will of man moved and excited by God, doth cooperate nothing att all, by giving her conſent to God exciting, and calling, by which he may diſpoſe himſelfe to the grace of Iuſtification, and that he cannot diſſent if he will, let him be Anathema.</hi> Lett thoſe harken to this, who harken ſo much to the Ianſeniſts. And let us go on to ſpeake of this ſufficient grace, which, in the next point, wee will ſhew more fully to be offered to all. Of this grace Iſaias 5.4. <hi>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> For Prov. 1.24. <hi>I called you, and you refuſed.</hi> And that you may not ſay he only called, and did not ſtretch forth his hand to helpe, you to come, the next words are. <hi>I ſtretched forth my hand, and no man regarded. But ye have ſet at nought all my couſel.</hi> And Iſa. 65.12. <hi>When I called ye did not anſwer, when I ſpake ye did not heare, and did chooſe that wherin I delighted not.</hi> Though they <hi>did chooſe</hi> thus againſt Gods call, yet this his call was ſo ſufficient to have moved them, that God tels Ezechiel c. 3. v. 6. that if he had ſent him, <pb n="218" facs="tcp:59494:116"/> with ſo ſtrong and powerfull preaching to barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unknowen people, <hi>They ſurely would have heard thee But the houſe of Iſraël will not heart thee, for all the houſe of Iſraël are impudent and hard harted.</hi> They will not be moved by thoſe calls which would move others. And becauſe they anſwered like Proteſtants c. 33.10. <hi>If our tranſgreſsions and our ſinns be upon us, and we pine in them how should we then live</hi> God commands the Catholicke doctrine to be thus delivered. <hi>Say unto them. As I live, ſayth the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and live. Turne ye, turne ye from your wicked wayes, and why will you dye ô houſe of Iſraël.</hi> Note how ſtill he ſayth, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites them ſufficiently, otherwiſe vainly had he ſayd, <hi>why will you dye ô houſe of Iſraël?</hi> For they might reply, <hi>we cannot but dye, becauſe thou giveſt us not the grace to live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as God ſayd of Ezechiels preaching, that it was ſufficient to have converted Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians (though the Iewes would not be moved by it.) So Matth. 11. v. 20. of Chriſt it is ſayd. <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to upbraid the Citties wherein were done the moſt of his miracles, for that they had not done pennance. Wo be to the Corozain, wo he to the Bethſaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had bene wrought the miracles, that were wrought in thee, they had done pennance in hairecloath and ashes long ago.</hi> Though the Iewes wold not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet hence I am ſure that Chriſt did ſufficient
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59494:116"/> for that end. Hence that moſt juſt exprobration both here and Matth. 23.37. <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem how often would I have gathered together thy Children, as the hen gathereth together her chickins, and thou wouldeſt not</hi> I would, <hi>thou wouldeſt not,</hi> therefore juſtly it followes. <hi>Behold your houſe shal he left deſert;</hi> Again Rom. 10 21. <hi>All the day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gainſaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Again Apoc. 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the dore and knock; if any man heare my voice and open the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, I will come in to him.</hi> Whence again 1. Tim. 2.4 <hi>Who will all men to be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth.</hi> And therefore the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 2. v. 4. <hi>Doeſt thou contemne the riches of his goodneſſe, Patience, Longanimity; but according to the hardnes of thy hart thou heapeſt up to thy ſelfe wrath.</hi> Behold a free will able to contemne the <hi>very riches of Gods goodnes,</hi> in ſtill giving graces, and with ſo much patience and longanimity expecting the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of them, ſtill (by mans voluntary malice) made fruitles. Of ſuch a ſoule it is ſayd Apoc. 2.21. <hi>I gave her ſpace to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.</hi> You cannot blame a poore man for not dining, becauſe you gave him ſpace to dine, unles you allſo give him meat wherewith to dine, ſo God could not complain of our not repenting becauſe we had time, unleſſe allſo he offered us grace to repent.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XXXIII. POINT.</hi> This ſufficient grace is denyed to none, Chriſt dying even for reprobates.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is evident in Scripture that no grace is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any but by the merits of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated with his death. <hi>He hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſsings in heavenly things in Chriſt.</hi> Eph. 1.3. So that if you ſee (Point 30.) Grace given to all to make the keeping of the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all; if you ſee (point
31.) That our free will is ſtill by Gods grace able to do good; if you ſee (Point 32.) This free will ſtill helped by ſufficient Grace to avoid evill and do good; you muſt needs by all this ſee, that this grace can come only from Chriſts death; and therfore this grace, being ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proved to be offered to all, by the ſame Texts it is allſo proved that Chriſt dyed for all. Call to minde how many (according to what was proved (Point 29.) do become reprobates, who by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts death, once received the guift of heavenly grace in Baptiſme. The like grace was by Chriſts death given to that juſt man, of whom Ezechiel cited there n. 5. ſayth, <hi>That his Iuſtices shall be forgotten,</hi> becauſe he perſevered not, <hi>and in his iniquities he shall dye.</hi> He therefore became a Reprobate. And thus it is true which God ſayd to <pb n="221" facs="tcp:59494:117"/> Abraham Gen. 12.3. <hi>In thee shall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> And Gcn. 22.18.
<hi>In thy ſeed shall be bleſſed all the nations of earth.</hi> Now as S. Paul ſayrh, Gal. 3.14. <hi>The bleſsing of Abraham comes on the Gentiles through Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> There is none ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be excepted from being partaker of this bleſſing, ſeing that <hi>all the families of the earth, and all the nations of the earth do enioy it.</hi> Yct it is evident that many among theſe families and nations be Reprobates. Reprobates therfore enioy many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by Chriſts death, which eould not be, if Chriſt did not dye for them. By the merits of Chriſts death <hi>many are called,</hi> yet of theſe many, <hi>few are chooſen.</hi> Matth. 22.14. Hence Ezech. 18.23. Why? <hi>Is the death of a ſinner my will (ſayth our Lord God) and not that he convert from his wayes, and live?</hi> Which without grace from Chriſt he could not do. Again c. 33.11. <hi>I will not the death of the impious, but that the impious convert from his way and live. Why will you dye ô houſe of Iſraël!</hi> And ſo Prov. 1.24. <hi>To thoſe to whome he ſayd, I have called and you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and you have not regarded.</hi> He ſhall ſay likewiſe, <hi>I will laugh when your deſtruction cometh, as a whirlewind.</hi> v. 27. They therfore <hi>shall be deſtroyed and perish,</hi> who by Chriſts death and merits, had many graces, helps, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, given them. Note that in Chriſt, the will, with which he called them, was a ſerious will, of which 1. Tim. 2.4. <hi>He will all men to be ſaved, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59494:118"/> to come to the knowledge of truth.</hi> See in the former Point, the many evident Text cited to this effect. Hence it is ſayd Rom. 2.4. He ſhewed <hi>the riches of his goodnes to thoſe who diſpiſed it treaſuring up wrath to themſelves.</hi> Who be thoſe but the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? Again 2. Pet. 3.9. <hi>Willing that none ſhould periſh.</hi> And Rom. 5.6. <hi>Chriſt did dye for the impious or ungodly.</hi> And moſt cleerly. 1. Io. 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation of our ſinns. And not for ours only, but allſo for the whole world.</hi> The <hi>whole world</hi> comprehends more reprobate then elect. He then who dyed for <hi>the whole world,</hi> did allſo dye for the Reprobate. Wherfore S. Paul more then once, warneth us not to be occaſion of damnation to thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed. So Rom. 14.15. <hi>Do not with thy meat deſtroy him for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for whom Chriſt dyed, may <hi>be deſtroyed,</hi> and periſh eternally. Again, 1. Cor. 8.11. <hi>Through thy knowledge shall thy weak Brother perish for whom Chriſt dyed?</hi> And again 2. Pet. 2.1.
<hi>Falſe teachers bringing in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord, who bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> Hence you ſee that even thoſe, <hi>who have brought upon themſelves deſtruction,</hi> have done this <hi>by denying him, who bought them</hi> at the price of his blood and death. He therfore even dyed for thoſe Children of perdition. Whence Holy Fathers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſay, <hi>that ſon of perdition,</hi> Iudas did ſhedde that blood with which he was redemed. Let us then
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59494:118"/> all be, as is ſayd 2. Cor. 5.14. <hi>Iudging this that if one dyed for all, then all were dead,</hi> S. Paul had not proved, by Chriſt his dying for all, <hi>that all were dead,</hi> if any man could be found, for whom Chriſt did not dye. And, that no one ſhould preſume to ſay, that any ſuch man could be found, S. Pauls next words are,
<hi>Chriſt dyed for all,</hi> v. 15. The Councel of Trent Seſſ. 6. c. 3. citing theſe words, ſayth: <hi>But though he dyed for all, yet all receive not the benefit of his death, but only thoſe to whom the merit of his Paſsion is communicated.</hi> Hence it is ſayd 1. Tim. 4.10. <hi>We truſt in the liveing God who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe who believe.</hi> Saviour he is to all men, by giveing what ſufficeth to ſave all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but this ſufficiency is effectuall to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only in the truly faithfull, whoſe works anſwered to theyr beliefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore chiefely, he is <hi>theyr Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Yet it is true, that ſpeaking generally of us all, 1. Cor. 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not permit you to be tempted above what you are able.</hi> But now it is moſt evident that God doth dayly permit us to be tempted beyond our owne power, becauſe no power, wee have of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, is able, or ſufficient, to reſiſt thoſe temptations, which dayly ſett upon us. Seeing therefore it is cleare Scripture, <hi>that God will not ſuffer us to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted above what wee are able,</hi> it hence demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely followeth, that Gods grace ſufficiently ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles all men to reſiſt any temptation whatſoever
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59494:119"/> fals upon them. This is that which we properly call giving <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> to all men, though all will not reſiſt the temptations, which they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt. Even as he ſufficiently by nature enables moſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lift theyr ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d up to theyr head though ſome for lazynes will not do it. Now the grace ſufficiently enabling all to reſiſt all kind of temptations, is given them through the merits of Chriſt dying for them.</p>

                  <hi>THE XXXIV. POINT.</hi> How our good works done in grace, and by the helpe of Chriſts grace, be meritorious, and merit life everlaſting.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THis is a point in which our adverſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pleaſed to be much ſcandalized, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe many of theyr teachers have notably belyed us: in ſo much that you ſhall find few who are not apt to thinke, that wee hide our doctrine, as aſhamed of it. Whereas wee do plainly and cleerly tell them, that none of our works deſerves any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly reward, as it is the worke (and even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt worke) of man, done only by our naturall free will. But wee all, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d every one of us, teach, that thoſe only good works are meritorious, which are done <hi>firſt,</hi> by a ſoul dignifyed with Gods grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59494:119"/> in her, (accordingly to the 28. Point) and wee ſay that the value of this action (makeing it meritorious proceeds from this grace. <hi>Secondly</hi> wee ſay no man can do any ſuch meritorious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the actuall grace of God exciting him therunto. <hi>Thirdly</hi> we ſay the grace of God muſt be aiding, and aſſiſting him all the time he doth any ſuch meritorious action. All this is taught by the Councel of Trent ſeſſ. 6. c. 14. Wee adde that, even to ſuch actions done in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, God (if ſo he had pleaſed) might have given no reward. But he was pleaſed to promiſe, and to give this heavenly reward out of his free gratious goodnes, he being, moved by the merits and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, (from which all the foreſaid graces flows) to accept, for his ſake, all thoſe works, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable; the ſaid works, by his grace, being made worthy to be accepted of ſo, as to be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly reward, which God hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully promiſed to them. This is our doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the very beginning of the world God taught this doctrine ſaying to Cain. Gen. 4.7. <hi>If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> When Abraham was ready to offer Iſaac, God by an Angel ſayd to him Gen. 22. v. 16. <hi>By my own ſelfe have I ſworne (ſayth the Lord) becauſe thou haſt done this thing, I will bleſſe thee, &amp;c:</hi> Behold a large bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for doing <hi>this thing.</hi> David allſo Pſal. 18.20. <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſſe.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59494:120"/> According to the cleanes of my hands; hath he recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me.</hi> And Pſal. 19. v. 11. <hi>That in keeping Gods precepts there is great reward.</hi> And his Sonne Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſayth 1. Kings
8.32. <hi>God is juſtifying the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, to give him according to his righteouſnes.</hi> And that zelous Prophet ſpeaks thus 2. Chron. 15.7.
<hi>Be you ſtrong therfore, and let not your hands be weak, for your worke shall be rewarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How often hath S. Matthew this doctrine?
<hi>Firſt</hi> c. 5.12. <hi>Be glad and rejoyce, for your reward is great in heaven.</hi> Here the word which (both in Greek, and Latin) is put for
<hi>Reward,</hi> doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignify the very wages, or hire due to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. <hi>Secondly</hi> in ſeverall places of the ſixth chapter Chriſt exhorts us to the ſecret performance both of our <hi>Faſts,</hi> our
<hi>Almes-deeds,</hi> and of our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and he tells us, that otherwiſe <hi>wee looſe our reward. But if wee do them in ſecret, thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, will repay the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly</hi> c. 6. v.
20. <hi>Lay up for your ſelves treaſures in heaven. Fourthly</hi> c. 16.27.
<hi>He shall reward every man according to his works.</hi> He ſayth not according to his mercy, but according to <hi>theyr works. Fiftly,</hi> c.
19.27. <hi>Wee have left all and followed thee, what therefore shall wee have?</hi> To them, thus expecting a reward, Chriſt gives no check, but makes them a promiſe of having, upon the account of theyr works, <hi>a hundred fould in the preſent, and life everlaſting in the future life. Sixtly</hi> c. 25.23. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faithfull over a few things,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59494:120"/> I shall place the over many things. Enter into the joy of our Lord.</hi> Note here <hi>many things</hi> given in heaven,
<hi>becauſe</hi> ſuch a man lived faithfully. So <hi>Seaventhly</hi> c. 25. v. 34. <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father poſſeſſe &amp;c. For I was a hungry, thirſty &amp;c. And you gave me to eate, drink, &amp;c.</hi> Note the word <hi>For,</hi> that is, <hi>For this very cauſe come poſſeſſe the Kingdome.</hi> So if a Prince, taken by his enimies in warre, ſhould be reſcued by a common ſouldier, whom he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferring to be a Colonel, ſhould ſay, <hi>I make you a Colonel, for I was taken, and you freed me,</hi> who can doubt, but that theſe words cleerly affirme the cauſe of this great reward, to be the ſouldiers great merit. So contrarywiſe, where in that Chapter it followeth. <hi>Gett you away you curſed, into fire everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. For I was a hungry, and you did not feed me &amp;c.</hi> Every one will confeſſe, that the particle <hi>For,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſignifies the <hi>Cauſe. My eighth,</hi> and laſt text is of S. Matth. c. 10.42. <hi>Whoſoever shall give to one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water, only in the name of a Diſciple, Amen I ſay unto you, he shall not looſe his reward.</hi> Other Texts might be alledged out of other Evangeliſts, as Mark 10. v. 21. <hi>Go ſell whatſoever thou haſt, and thou shalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> And again Io. 5. 29. <hi>They that have done good things, shall go forth into the Reſurrection of life.</hi> Behold the reward of good works. And again Luke 14. 14. <hi>For feaſting the poore recompence shall be made in the Reſurrection.</hi>

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59494:121"/>4. But to proceed; how often allſo doth S. Paul inculcate this doctrine? As <hi>firſt</hi> 1. Cor. 3.8.
<hi>Every one shall receive his own reward, according to his own labours. Secondly</hi> 2. Cor. 4.17. <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us an eternal weight of glory.</hi> Note the word
<hi>worketh,</hi> which really ſignifieth the <hi>cauſe. Thirdly,</hi> 2. Cor. 9.6. <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſparingly allſo shall reap. And he that ſoweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</hi> Note here Almeſdeeds made the <hi>ſeed of glory. Fourthly</hi> there againe, v. 10.
<hi>As it is written, he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, he gave to the poore</hi> (But with what effect?) <hi>his righteouſnes remaineth for ever. Fifthly</hi> Gal. 6.9
<hi>Be not weary in well doing,</hi> why ſo? <hi>For in due ſeaſon wee shall reap if wee faint not. Sixthly</hi> Eph. 6.8. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that every one, what good ſo ever he shall do, that shall he receive of our Lord. Seaventhly</hi> he ſeeks in his Convertites the doing of good works, by reaſon of the reward they ſhall receive for them. So Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 4.16. <hi>Ye ſent once and againe to my neceſsity; not becauſe I deſire the gift. But I deſire the fruit that may abound to your account.</hi> Behold S. Paul deſired the encreaſe of theyr merit. <hi>Eightly</hi> 1. Tim. 6.17.
<hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge them that are rich, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute Laying up ſtore for themſelves, a good fundation againſt the time to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that they may lay hold of an eternall life. Ninthly</hi> Tim. 2.4.8 <hi>There is layed up for me a Crowne of righteouſnes, which our Lord will render to me in <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59494:121"/> that day a juſt Iudge, and not only to me, but &amp;c.</hi> It is his mercy to promiſe heaven to our good works, it is his mercy to give us that grace which confers all the meritorious value upon theſe works; it is his mercy to excite us by actuall grace to performe ſuch works, and to accompany and aſſiſt us whilſt wee work. But it is his <hi>Iuſtice and righteouſnes</hi> to give that reward, which his mercy made theſe works able to deſerve. So that now as a <hi>juſt Iudge</hi> he rewards our merits, though they be his gifts.
<hi>Tenthly</hi> Heb. 11.24. <hi>Moyſes refuſed to be called the Sonne of Pharao his daughter, chooſing to be afflicted with the people of God, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſures in Aegypt. For he had reſpect unto the recompence of the reward.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how much Moyſes valued <hi>the recompence of the reward,</hi> due to ſo meritorious an act as that was. And <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Hebr. 10.35.
<hi>Caſt not away your confidence, which hath recompenſe of great reward.</hi> I might end all theſe Texts with that of the Apocal. 22.12.
<hi>My reward is with me, to give every one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his works shall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But I thought fitt to adde that wee Roman Catholicks do ſo extoll the dignity of good works in regard of that value given them by the grace of Chriſt (merited for us by his Paſſion) that wee ſay theſe works, thus dignifyed, make us worthy of heavenly bliſſe. And this wee prove by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. S. Paul Col. 1.12. <hi>Who hath made us meet to be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59494:122"/> partakers of the inheritance of Saints.</hi> And Apoc.
3.4. <hi>But thou haſt a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled theyr garments, and the shall walke with me, in whites, becauſe they are worthy.</hi> Hence Pſal. 18.21. <hi>The Lord shall reward me after my righteous doings. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cleanes of my hands shall he recompenſe me.</hi> See Point 28. n. 2. 3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againſt ſo many and ſo cleare Texts our Adverſaries chiefly object; <hi>Firſt</hi> that the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Iſa. 64.6.
<hi>Wee are all as an uncleane thing, and all our righteouſnes are as filthy raggs.</hi> I anſwer this is ſayd of us and our works done meerly by us, as wee are left to our ſelves, borne and growen up in ſin, and not aided, nor clenſed and dignified, by Gods grace. And it is a ſtrange inference of our Adverſaries, to draw from hence, that our beſt works done in grace, and by the helpe of Gods grace, be all deadly ſinns. For ſo in the Texts cited, David could not be <hi>rewarded after his righteouſnes, and according to the cleanes of his hands.</hi> Neither ſhould there be any of ſo <hi>unfiled garments, as to walke in whites becauſe they are worthy;</hi> again how ſayth S Iames, c. 2.21. <hi>Abraham was he not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed by works offering Iſaac? Seeſt thou not how faith wrought with his works, and byworks was made perfect?</hi> How ſo, if both his faith, and his works were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adly ſinns? What? doth God thus reward deadly ſin? or could ſuch a ſin be a worke <hi>juſtifying</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham? In the Texts n. 6. It is ſayd that God
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59494:122"/> will repay us <hi>for faſting, praying, giving almes in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</hi> How is this true, if all theſe works be deadly ſins in us? Tell me how it is poſſible by heaping up deadly ſinns to do what Chriſt bids us, that is, <hi>to heap up treaſures in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The yong man (of whom I ſpook) was told that by ſelling all, he ſhould purchaſe
<hi>a treaſure in heaven.</hi> How then? was this ſelling all a deadly ſin? If ſelling all be a deadly ſin, then to ſay, <hi>If thou will be perfect go and ſell all,</hi> is to ſay, <hi>go and do a deadly ſin, if thou wilt be perfect.</hi> Is that the <hi>one thing</hi> that was <hi>wanting unto him?</hi> And thus I might argue out of moſt of the above cited Texts. I am ſure Chriſt ſayth, Matth. 3.10. <hi>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, his hewen down, and caſt into the fire.</hi> If the fruit of no tree be good, then every tree muſt be burned S. Iames 1.26. <hi>Of the doer of the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſayth. <hi>This man shall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> And S. Paul Phil. 4.18. calls the almes ſent to him, <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmel, a Sacrifice acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable, well pleaſing to God.</hi> Theſe almeſdeeds then were not <hi>filthy raggs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly they object out of Luk 17.10. <hi>When you have done all that you are commanded, ſay wee are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> I anſwer this is true, that by all wee do, or can do, even by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, wee are ſervants unprofitable to God. For all wee do, or can do, profits him nothing. But wee are ſervants profitable to our ſelves.
<hi>For heaping up treaſure in heaven,</hi> and <hi>making friends of Mammon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59494:123"/> to receive us into the eternall Tabernacles,</hi> are things very profitable unto us, as allſo to be <hi>good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants, and therfore to be placed over much, and enter into the joy of our Lord.</hi> S Paul ſayd 1. Cor. 13.3. <hi>If I should diſtribute all my goods to be meat to the poore, and have not Charity, it doth profit me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Ergò with Charity it profits me much.</hi> Yea though faithfull ſervants be thus unprofitable to God, yet in regard of the ſervice they do him, he ſayth Io. 15. v. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you:</hi> a thing of no ſmall profit and honour. Again, is it not, think you, any profit to have <hi>a hundred fold here in this world, and life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the next</hi> for leaving what they had for his like? Is it no profit to us to ſay truly with S. Paul Col. 1 12. <hi>He hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints, and to walke with him in whites, becauſe wee are worthy.</hi> Apoc 3.4. Had he no profit by overcoming to whome it was ſayd <hi>He that shall overcome and keepe my works untill the end, I will give him</hi> (in heaven) <hi>power over the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of Iron?</hi> Apoc. 2.26.
<hi>Hee that shall overcome, I will give to ſitt with me in my throne</hi> Apoc. 3.21. <hi>Do wee</hi> not then by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, profit our ſelves in a high degree?</p>

                  <hi>THE XXXV. POINT.</hi> It is laudable to doo good works for reward.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS Charity towards our neighbour is a moſt commendable vertue, ſo charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves cannot be but moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wherefore ſeeing theſe good works do profit us ſo very much, (as wee have ſeen in the laſt point and laſt number) I cannot poſſibly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Paradox of our Adverſaries, ſaying,
<hi>they do ill, who do well out of a deſire to gain heaven.</hi> True it is, a man may do well out of a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable motive, that is to honour and pleaſe God. But becauſe ſomething is better then doing good for hope of reward, the doing good out of that hope, doth not ceaſe to be good. You ſay faith alone is ſo good, that <hi>it doth juſtify a man,</hi> and yet Scripture tells you, that of theſe three, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and
<hi>Charity,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> (and better) of theſe, <hi>is Charity.</hi> 1. Cor. 13.13. Faith is very good and commendable. Whence appeares that nothing ceaſes to be good, becauſe an other act is better.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scriptures cited in the laſt point evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently exhort us in our ſufferings, <hi>to be glad and <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59494:124"/> rejoyce, becauſe our reward is great in heaven,</hi> and to <hi>do our good works in ſecret, not to looſe our reward,</hi> but to <hi>heap up to our ſelves treaſure in heaven, and to ſell all to purchaſe treaſure</hi> there, and <hi>in doing good works not to fail, for in due time wee shall reap, not failing.</hi> May wee not ſow in hope of harveſt? Did not S. Paul,
<hi>ſeek the fruit abounding on this account to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who had ſent to his uſe.</hi> Did he not bid us, not <hi>to looſe our confidence, becauſe it hath a great reward?</hi> Hebr. 10.35. And <hi>not to ſow ſparingly that wee may reap plentifully.</hi> 2. Cor. 9.6. Did not Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſay,
<hi>make friends of the Mammon of iniquity.</hi> Luk 16.9. To what end this? To the end, <hi>that they may receive you into the eternal Tabernacles.</hi> But what can be more cleer then that which I there cited out of Heb. 11.24.
<hi>Moyſes denyed himſelf to be the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pharao his daughter, chuſing to be afflicted with the people of God, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſure of Aegyptians. For he looked to the reward, or</hi> (according to your Bibles) <hi>for the regard, or reſpect, he had to the reward.</hi> No leſſe cleer Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Pſalm. 118. verſ. 112. <hi>I have inclined my hart to do thy Iuſtifications for ever for reward. And for this reward he inclined his hart to do them,</hi> ſayth S. Auguſtin in this place, reading it as wee do. And ſo (as wee tead it) it is ſo faithfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Septuaginta out of the Hebrew, and ſo your Tranſlatours might have tranſlated it, if they had pleaſed, but they willfully chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="235" facs="tcp:59494:124"/> ſenſe, though they ſo much profeſſe to follow the Septuaginta.</p>

                  <hi>THE XXXVI. POINT.</hi> VVee laudably worship Angels and Saints.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FOr the ground of this queſtion I lay this fundation out of Scripture, that as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are in heaven, ſo the ſoules of the Saints go directly from hence to heaven, without they have ſome few offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to cleere in Purgatory. Our ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſleep not untill Doomeſday. Chriſt ſayd to the good theife. <hi>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</hi> And therefore S. Paul deſired to <hi>be diſſolved, that he might be with Chriſt.</hi> And again, 2. Cor. 5.8. <hi>Wee are willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with our Lord,</hi> Therefore wee may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>to be preſent with our Lord,</hi> even whilſt
<hi>our ſoules are abſent from our body.</hi> Neither do our Engliſh Proteſtants deny this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſuppoſed, our doctrine is, that great reverence and worſhip is due to the Angels, and Saints with God.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> that they can hear our prayers. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that they can, and will helpe us, and therfore it is laudable to pray to them, and that this doth not derogate from Chriſts honour. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that among the Saints it is moſt laudable to pray to our Lady. And here wee ſhall ſpeak of <pb n="236" facs="tcp:59494:125"/> the Beads ſayd to her honour. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> wee laudably worſhip Images of Chriſt, and his Saints, <hi>Sixtly,</hi> that wee laudably worſhip theyr Reliques, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrine them richly, and place them as honorably as wee can. <hi>Sevently,</hi> that ſome places are more holy then others, ſanctifyed by the preſence of thoſe Reliques, or by ſpeciall graces given there. And for this reaſon wee laudably make proceſſions, and pilgrimages to theſe places with all devotion.
<hi>Eightly,</hi> that wee laudably keep Feaſts or Holy Dayes, as allſo faſts in the honour of Chriſt and his Saints. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> in theſe our faſts wee laudably abſtaine from certaine meates. All, and every one of theſe nine things ſhall have theyr particular proofes, in ſo many ſeverall Points next following in the order here deſigned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And <hi>firſt</hi> for the worſhip of Angels or Saints, note that the very ſelfe ſame outward worſhip, (yea and Adoration it ſelfe) may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly be given either <hi>as a civil reverence,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of reſpect and great eminency, or it may be given to them out of a
<hi>religious reſpect,</hi> in regard of the great Sanctity and heavenly dignity in ſuch a perſon, or <hi>laſtly, given in regard of Divine perfection</hi> and infinite worth. When this reſpect is given thus outwardly, there paſſeth inwardly an act in our underſtanding apprehending the exellcency which wee honour, to be either human (as in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil honour) or to be an excellency of ſingular, <pb n="237" facs="tcp:59494:125"/> though limited, heavenly eminency (as in the worſhip of Saints which wee call
<hi>Dulia</hi>) or laſtly wee judge that there is a devine and infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in that perſon, as it happens in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God only, which wee call <hi>Latria.</hi> An other act paſſeth in our will, anſwerable to that which was in our underſtanding, by which wee have a will to make this outward worſhip or adoration, to be either a civil honour only, ſuch as is due to men, of higheſt human dignity, or to make it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip (though farre from devine) ſuch as is given to perſons of eminent Sanctity, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with great heavenly gifts: or laſtly wee intend to make it an act of devine worſhip, as when wee do it to God. Whence it is evident, that by doing of the outward act, it cannot be knowne whether the honour wee do, be meerly <hi>civil,</hi> or <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Devine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. With only civil adoration, <hi>Abraham roſe up and adored the people of the land.</hi> Gen. 23.7. Iacob coming into the preſence of his elder Brother E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, Gen. 33. v. 4. <hi>Going forward adored proſtrate to the ground ſeaven times.</hi> And v. 7. <hi>Lia with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren adored in like manner,</hi> and laſt <hi>Ioſeph and Rachel adored.</hi> And Gen. 43, v. 27. <hi>Ioſephs Brethren offered him preſents, holding them in theyr hands, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored proſtrate to the ground.</hi> And again Gen. 50. v. 18, <hi>And Ioſephs Brethren came to him, and adoring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground.</hi> All theſe Texts are thus read in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59494:126"/> the Rhemiſh Teſtament. But the Proteſtant Bible refuſing to put the word <hi>Adore,</hi> put either <hi>bowing down, or falling down on theyr face.</hi> Wee do no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re outwardly when wee worſhip Saints, or adore God. Wherfore to prove what I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you ſee I need go no further then Geneſis, but I thought fitt to adde one very fitt paſſage of 1. Chron. 29. v. 20. <hi>All the aſſemble bowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves downe, and worshiped the Lord, and the King.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriouſly
<hi>the bowing</hi> was both alike to thc ground, but the inward act made this bowing as done to the King, to be civil honour, only, and the like bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing as done to God, to be devine honour or <hi>worship,</hi> and true adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the moſt rigorous ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. It is very ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to obſerve how cunningly your Bibles ſtill avoid the word <hi>Adore</hi> eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to God which ſeemes ſo often omitted by them becauſe the ſame word ſignifying <hi>to adore,</hi> is ſo often applyed to creatures you cannot then blame us if, when wee reverence Saints, or pray to them, wee bow, kneel, or proſtrate our ſelves to the ground. <hi>even ſeaven times.</hi> For if civil worſhip (for this word the laſt Text hath) may paſſe ſo farre, without robbing God of his honour, why may not an inferiour Religious
<hi>worship</hi> do the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke?</p>
               <p n="5">5. But of this adoring for Religious worſhip, wee have cleer Scripture. Ioſue (c. 5.) being told by an Angel, that this Angel
<hi>was but a Captain of <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59494:126"/> the Hoſts of our Lord, Ioshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship.</hi> v. 14. Behold before wee had <hi>worship</hi> given by the people to the King, here wee have <hi>worship done</hi> to an Angel, known to be an <hi>Angel.</hi> By and by (in the Apocalips) wee ſhall ſee this very word of <hi>worship,</hi> to ſignify the Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which is to be given to God. Now I go on, and I obſerve that the Angel was not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admitt of this honour, but commanded him allſo to ſhew reverence to the very place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Holy by his preſence.
<hi>Looſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>thy shoes, from thy feet, for the place wherin thou doeſt ſtand, is Holy.</hi> If any reply that wee may, with Religious worſhip, adore Angels, as Ioſue did, but not Saints, behold the Scripture ſheweth this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip or adoration, (due to ſpirituall excellency) to be laudably given even to thoſe who excell in ſanctity, even in this world. So 1. Kings 18.7. <hi>Abdias governour of the houſe of Achab, King of Iſraël, meeting with (poore) Elias the Prophet, when he knew him, fell, on his facë, and ſayd, My Lord, art not thou Elias?</hi> And 2. Kings 2. v. 15. <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Prophets ſeing Elizeus, ſayd, the ſpirit of Elias hath reſted upon him, and coming to meet him, adored him flat to the ground,</hi> or (as you read) <hi>They bowed themſelves to the ground,</hi> before him. See you not here that it was not for any worldly excellency, but meerly in regard of his ſpirituall excellency, <hi>that they thus bowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before him.</hi> 
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:59494:127"/> This ſpirituall excellency is incomparably more eminent in thoſe who are now made Coheires to Chriſt himſelfe, in the partciipation of all heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts and glory. To them therfore Religious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, or worſhip, is farre <hi>more</hi> due: and wee are comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by S. Paul. Rom. 13.6.7. <hi>To render to all theyr due, to whom honour, honour. Owe to no man any thing</hi> which you do not pay him. This I ſtaid upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe our Adverſaries often aske for a precept commanding us to honour Saints. Behold I have given you one, which is a precept grounded in the very Law of nature and equity, cammaunding us to render to teach one what is due to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, Apoc. 3.9. <hi>Behold I will make them come, and worship hefore thy feet:</hi> words ſpoaken to the Angel of Philadelphia. If by this Angel you ſay the Biſhop of Philadelphia is underſtood, then we prove firſt that, <hi>(a fortiore)</hi> wee may worſhip before the feet of the chiefe Biſhop of the Church. Secondly wee much more, <hi>(a fortiore)</hi> inferre that wee may worſhip before the feet of thoſe, who have a farre greater excellency in vertue, grace, glory, as Saints have above all men on earth. For Matth. 11.11. <hi>Hee that is the leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven, is greater then he</hi> (that is, is greater then the great S. Iohn Baptiſt was upon earth) though of him Chriſt himſelfe ſayd; <hi>There had not riſen a greater among the ſons of weomen.</hi> S. Iohn the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt then knowing it to be true which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59494:127"/> had written, <hi>that Chriſt would make men come, and worship before the feet of the Angel of Philadelphia,</hi> thought it is duty to adore before the feet of any Angel, and hence he ſayth of himſelfe Apoc.
19. v. 10. And <hi>I fell at this feet to worship him,</hi> (the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) and again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 22. v. 8. <hi>I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel, which shewed me thoſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Our adverſaries object, that at each of theſe adorations the Angel checked S. Iohn for them, ſaying at each time. <hi>See thou do not, I am thy fellow ſervant: worship God.</hi> Our anſwer is, that if the firſt adoration, (uſed by S. Iohn) had been of its own nature Idolatrous, and ſinfull, (which is incredible, it proceeding from ſo great a Prophet, and ſo ſublime a Scripture writer) yet at leſt being told ſo, and inſtructed by the Angel to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (as you ſay he was) he would never the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time have done that Idolatrous, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinfull act, both wittingly, and willingly; and this ſo very ſoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after he had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warned not to do it. It was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of any unlawfulnes in this action, that the Angel willed him not to ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re or worſhip: But the Angel refuſed at both ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes this honour, upon ſome other conſideration, to witt, out of ſingular reſpect unto him, whom he knew to have been at the laſt ſupper, admitted to ly on Chriſts breaſt, and ſo he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt him to ly now proſtrate at his feete, whom he <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59494:128"/> allſo knew to be ſo highly favored by God, with ſo many admirable heavenly viſions: Moreover to be a Virgin; to be a Prieſt, an Apoſtle, and to be that very Diſciple whom Ieſus ſo ſingularly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: to be allſo a Prophet and an Evangeliſt. Therefore he would not admitt of ſuch profound reſpect at his hands, but humbly ſaying unto him, <hi>I pray do it not, for I am thy fellow ſervant,</hi> and thou either now art greater in Gods ſight then I am, or ſoon mayeſt come to be farre greater.
<hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>adore God,</hi> who hath ſo magnifyed thee. Yet S. Iohns humility working ſtill upon him more, by ſeeing an Angel ſo humble, and producing in him a mean conceipt of himſelfe, (by ſtill reflecting on what he was as of himſelfe and knowing what his maiſter ſayd, <hi>that even the leſſer in the Kingdome of heaven was greater then the great S. Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (to witt according to the preſent ſtate) he therefore did the ſecond time ſhew the Angel the honour he knew due to him. (See above how Ioſue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped an Angel) which honour notwithſtanding was allſo refuſed by the Angel in this place, both for the former reaſons, and for that he knew full well how much this great humility of his had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him yet higher.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Theyr ſecond objection is that of S. Paul Col. 2.18.
<hi>Let no man beguile you in worshiping of Angels.</hi> To anſwer this objection, note that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paſſage of S Iohn happened to him, when he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59494:128"/> was in baniſhment in the Iland called <hi>Patmos.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc. 1. Whence it is manifeſt that S. Iohn in his Apocalips, now cited, uſed both theſe two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall adorations, twice worſhiping the Angel, long after S. Paul had written theſe words, forbidding the <hi>worship of Angels,</hi> which words S Iohn under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood either much better, (or at leſt full as well) as our Proteſtants underſtand them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew very well that in adoring or worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Angel, two ſeverall times, he, in neither of theſe times, <hi>was ſeduced in the worship of Angels.</hi> Wee therefore may adore Angels, a S Iohn did, and yet not <hi>be beguiled in this worship of Angels,</hi> as S. Iohn was not. Thoſe then are rather ſeduced by willfull miſtake, of what <hi>this worship of Angels is,</hi> who, (to make us guilty of it) define it to be ſuch a <hi>worship,</hi> as muſt make S. Iohn as guilty, as they would make us. Therefore this Text is fondly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt us, for holding only and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>ſuch worship</hi> of Angels, as S Iohn uſed twice, and that long after he knew what S. Paul had written. This then ſerves our turne, that in what ſenſe ſoever S. Paul is to be underſtood, he cannot be underſtood in a ſenſe, forbidding any thing contrary, to that which S. Iohn did, and which wee (with him) do practiſe. The truth is S. Paul ſpeaks only of ſuch Religious worſhip of Angels, as had been taught among the Iewes by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who would have Sacrifice offered to all <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59494:129"/> Angels, as well evill as good. <hi>Epiph. hereſi</hi> 25. <hi>Chryſoſtom. Hom.</hi> 7. <hi>in hunc locum.</hi> And this is that which is condemned in the Councel of Loadicia c. 35.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is another very pertinent expoſition of this Text in <hi>Tertul. l.</hi> 5. <hi>contra Marcionem.</hi> That is, that the Apoſtle laboreth in that place to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, that the new Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould not keep the old Iudaicall Law, and for this end he ſayth, <hi>let no man beguile you in the worship of Angels,</hi> by ſaying that wee owe ſo much reſpect to the Angels, that although Chriſt hath aboliſhed the old Law, yet becauſe that old Law was given them by the Miniſtery of Angels, (Act.
7.53.) it ought ſtill to be kept, out of reſpect to the Angels, by whoſe Miniſtery it was given. Again, ſome then taught that this, as a heavenly verity, had been revealed by ſome of the Angels. But the Angels, revealers of ſuch doctrine, being Angels of darknes, S. Paul calleth the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall obſervation of meats (maintained by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Chriſtians out of this principle) <hi>the doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> 1. Tim. 4.1. Such allſo <hi>is the worship of Angels</hi> given them by ſuch obſervances. And it is to be noted, that immediately before theſe words, he expreſly ſpook againſt the Iudaicall obſervation of meats, ſaying, <hi>let no man judge you in meat.</hi> v. 16.

                  <hi>THE XXXVII. POINT.</hi> The Angels and Saints can hear our Prayers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. PRoteſtants undertaking to reforme all our pretended errors out of Scripture, can, with no ground, pretend to reforme our error in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Saints to hear us, unles they can ſhew ſome cleer Text to prove that Saints cannot hear us. It is enough for us to go on ſtill believing what wee ever believed, unles they can ſhew us Scripture to the contrary. They produce but one poor Text falling farre ſhort of any cleer proofe. It is Iſa. 63. v. 16. <hi>Thou art our father, though Abraham be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of us, and Iſraël acknowledge us not. Thou ô Lord art our father, our Redeemer.</hi> I anſwer that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes conſidering how enormiouſly they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſwarved from the life, example, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Abraham, and Iacob, did with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon feare that they would not look upon them as theyr Children, as that word <hi>acknowledge</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. Wherefore knowing Gods mercy to be infinitely greater, then that of the greateſt Saints, they hoped that he ſtill would looke upon them. They did not ſay Abraham, and Iacob knew not theyr ſtate, or condition; but they conceived that <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59494:130"/> they for theyr ſinns (well known to them) had all reaſon not to owne them as Children, and to ſay, <hi>wee know you not:</hi> as Chriſt ſhall ſay one day, to the reprobate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, though wee ſhould graunt that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and Iacob did not know the ſtate of the Iewes then, when Abraham and Iacob were ſtill <hi>in Limbo Patrum,</hi> it doth not follow that the Saints, now preſent with God, enlightned with the light of beatificall glory, cannot (by vertue of that light) know all that paſſeth on earth, as farre (at leſt) as any thing maketh to theyr felicity. For it is a part of hapines to know how things paſſe with our deerly beloved friends, eſpecially when wee are in a condition to helpe them eaſily, as the Saints are, Yet is allſo falſe that Abraham, even <hi>in Limbo</hi> knew not what paſſed among the Iewes after his death. For he could tell <hi>Dives</hi> that his <hi>five Brethren had Moyſes and the Prophets</hi> Luke 16. v. 28. though Moyſes and the Prophets lived long after his death. See n. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As our adverſaries have but this one poor proofe out of Scripture againſt us, ſo wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve many for us. Iacob calls upon an Angel to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe his Children. No man would call upon one, who could not hear. The Text is Gen. 48 v. 16. I ſhall ſpeak largely of it in the next Point, n. 2. Again, 1. Sam. 28. The witch whom Saul conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, calling by her charmes upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the divel inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59494:130"/> was heard by him, for preſently ſhe did that, which without helpe of ſome ill ſpirit, could not be done. Shall devells hear witches preſently, and ſhall ſaints want power to hear their ſuppliants? See what I here ſay, n. 7. Raphel, (<hi>one of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which asſiſt before our Lord,</hi> Tob. 12.15.) Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be there aſſiſting, yet he truly told To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, v.
12. <hi>When thou didſt pray with tears, and didſt bury the dead by night, I offered thy prayer to our Lord.</hi> If this be not Canonical Scripture, yet at leſt it is a moſt ancient Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, and of ſuch credit, that <hi>SS. Cyprian, Ambr. Auſtin, Hierom, Gregory, the</hi> 3.
<hi>Councel of Carthage,</hi> and many more, held it Scripture, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d conſequently they thought it as true as Scripture, that Saints could hear our prayers. And you muſt bring ſomething more then your owne imagination to diſcredit it on this account. Eliphaz in Iob c. 5.1. ſpoak thus to him (<hi>call now if there be any that will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi> This ſheweth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe of invocating Angels in that time, for as then, no Saints, but Angels were in heaven. Whence the Septuagint, (whom you uſe to extoll) do here interpret
<hi>the Saints</hi> to be, <hi>the Holy Angels.</hi> David ſuppoſed the Angels to hear him, when he ſung Pſalmes, whence he ſayth, <hi>before the Gods,</hi> (wee truly read the <hi>Angels) I will ſing prayſe unto the.</hi> Pſal. 138.1. No man will ſay, <hi>Ile ſing my ſong in the hearing of deaf men.</hi> The Angels then could <pb n="248" facs="tcp:59494:131"/> hear his ſong. Of the letters of Elias I will ſpeak by and by. n. 5. And there I ſhall ſhew that Elias after his death knew what paſſed, and tooke care for the people of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the new Teſtament Luke 15.10. <hi>There shall be joy before the Angels of God upon one ſinner ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done pennance.</hi> No act is more interior, and paſſeth more properly in the bottome of the hart, then the Converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſinner. Weeping, ſighing, groaning, knocking of the breaſts, may be done by Hypocrites. The Angels then, who joy at the converſion of a ſinner, muſt know this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they cannot know, unles they know the bottome of the harte by divine revelation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Luke 16.26. Though there was <hi>a great gulf fixed between the ſoules of Abraham and Dives,</hi> yet God gave then ſome meanes to hear what each of them ſayd. Can he then find no meanes for Saints, to hear us? Do not you Proteſtants ſay Abrahams ſoule was then in heaven. Could he hear Dives from hell, and can he not hear from earth thoſe who pray to him? Again there v. 29. <hi>Abraham ſayd to him</hi> (Dives) <hi>they have Moyſes and the Prophets.</hi> Moyſes and the Prophets lived many a yeare after Abraham was dead; and yet you ſee, Abraham knew there were ſuch men, who left ſuch bookes to the Iewes. <hi>Secondly</hi> he knew theyr bookes were yet extant.
<hi>Thirdly</hi> that theſe writings of theyrs were of no leſſe efficacy to convert <hi>Dives</hi> 
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59494:131"/> his five Brothers, then the preaching of a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from dead would be. If you ſay this is but a Parable, I anſwer that in Parables the Interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors muſt be made to ſpeake ſenſe, and not non-ſenſe, as it would be in one of Lucians Dialogues to make Iulius Ceſar diſcourſing with Alexander, about what they had ſeen in <hi>Charles the fift,</hi> who lived ſo long after theyr time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But I have reſerved one paſſage of the old Teſtament to declare in this place how Saints, even then, knew what paſſed. Elias departed out of this life (whether God knows) the eightenth yeare of King Ioſaphat, 2. Kings 2.11. Now <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat reigned five and twenty yeares.</hi> 2. Chron. 20.31. So that ſeaven yeares of Ioſaphats reigne paſſed after the departure of Elias. <hi>Then Ioram his ſon reigned for him.</hi> 2. Chron. 21.1. After ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of this Iorams reigne, v. 12. <hi>There came a writing to him from Elias the Prophet ſaying. Thus ſayth our Lord, becauſe thou haſt not walked in the wayes of Ioſaphat thy Father, &amp;c.</hi> And then he tels him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular wicked acts of his, all done after E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias was dead. Elias therefore being departed, knew what paſſed, and ſhewed his great care to help Gods people his Brethren, in writing after his departure, this letter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When Saints come to heaven, they ſee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re more by the light of glory, then wee can eaſily conceave. <hi>For now,</hi> (1. Cor.
13.9.) <hi>in part wee know, <pb n="250" facs="tcp:59494:132"/> and in part wee prophecy. But when that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is come, then that shall be done away which is in part.</hi> Hence S. Aug. l. 22. de Civit. c. 21. proveth that the Saints in heaven have more perfect knowledge of what paſſeth here, then wee have. The light of glory farre exceedeth the light of prophecy, and yet by that Prophets knew many ſecreets of the harts, and things farre out of theyr ſight. Samuel ſayth to Saul. 1. Sam. c. 9. v. 19. <hi>All that is in thy hart, I will tell thee.</hi> And 2. Kings 5.26. Elizeus ſayd to Giezi, <hi>Went not my hart with thee, when the man tourned again from of his chariot to meet thee.</hi> So Acts 5.4. S. Peter did ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull hart of Ananias ſaying to him. <hi>Why haſt thou conceived this thing in thy hart?</hi> Note, that as the light of prophecy is not a glorious glittering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but a quality inwardly inherent in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, elevating it; even ſo the light of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is no ſuch exteriour brightnes (as ſome may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend) but it is an interiour noble quality, and the nobleſt of all qualities, inherent to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, elevating, corroborating, and enabling it to a wonderfull perfection in knowledge: So that it is able perfectly to ſee God himſelf. Wee blind wormes very raſhly make thoſe bleſſed ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ignorant of our low affaires.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hear further to what authority, over the affaires of this world, God rayſeth his Saints, that hence you may ſee, how much it belongs to this <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59494:132"/> theyr authority to know how things paſſe here below. Apoc. 2.26. <hi>Hee that shall overcome, and keep my works, unto the end, I will give him power over the Nations, and hee shall rule them with a rod of Iron. And as a Veſſell of the potter they</hi> (who ſlight them) <hi>shall be broaken.</hi> Hee is a blind Ruler <hi>over Nations,</hi> who knows not what paſſeth even in the ſpirituall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, of Nations which be thoſe affaires that belong to his ruling power. Again, c. 3. v. 21. <hi>He that shall overcome, I will give unto him to ſett with me in my throne, as I allſo have overcome, and have ſitten with my Father in his throne.</hi> Do you think Saints, raiſed by God ſo high, have no meanes to know what wee do below? Is it not ſayd of the Divel Apoc.
12.10. <hi>That he accuſeth our Brethren night and day,</hi> which he cannot do, unles he firſt knowes in what to accuſe us. A ſhamefull thing it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this knowledge to Angels, which wee grant to Divels. See in the next Point n. 7. two evident Texts out of the Apocalips ſhewing the Angels, and Saints to offer, and conſequently to know, our prayers. And note, that all that I have ſayd from the fourth number to this place, proves the ſelfe ſame. The former Texts ſpeak indeed of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, but you ſee Saints raiſed to as high light of glory as thoſe Angels, beſides, they, living ſo mixt with them, and ſtill enjoying theyr converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it cannot but ſeeme ſtrange, that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould rejoyce at the Converſion of a ſinner, <pb n="252" facs="tcp:59494:133"/> and the Saints ſhould know nothing of it. Again, it being proved that Angels can hear us, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (upon that account) deny, prayers to Angels to be lawfull, ſeeing that they hear us as well as the Saints living upon earth, whoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wee may lawfully crave. If you ſay that wee are not commanded to pray to them, I anſwer, ſo wee are not commanded to begg one anothers prayers. Tis ſufficient that, as our ſpirituall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities command us to do this, ſo they command us much more to do that. But of this in the next Point, n. 1. See there n 7. two more Texts out of the Apocalips, ſhewing Saints to hear our prayers. For the 24. Seniors were Saints, and not Angels, yet they knew and preſented our prayers made here on earth.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XXXVIII. POINT.</hi> That Saints can, and will help us, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it is laudable to pray to them.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrſt Proteſtants often ask us where wee have a command to pray to Angels or Saints. I anſwer that if there be many advantages accruing to us by the devout Invocation of Saints then it is apparent that Prudence and Charity to our ſelves ought to excite us thereunto, as it doth <pb n="253" facs="tcp:59494:133"/> to ſeek ſhelter when it raines, without beeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to go under ſhelter by the cryers voice as they ſay ſome ſimple people are: it is as ſimple to exact a comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in a thing of greater benefit. I ſay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover that if there be a command to begg the prayers of Saints living on earth, that command (a fortiore) urgeth us to begg the prayers of Saints living in heaven, they being more willing and more able to help us. If there be no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet wee may without any command, practiſe that laudably; ſo allſo may wee laudably practiſe this without a command, ſeeing that they hear us, as well as the Saints living with us. Why then may wee not ſay to Saints in heaven, that which S. Paul ſayd to Saints on earth, <hi>Brethren pray for us?</hi> Iobs friends were commanded to go to Iob to pray for them, as wee ſhall ſhew more fully n. 9. You all keep the Sunday. Where is that commanded to you? You anſwer, it is ſufficient to ſee examples of it among the firſt Chriſtians. So ſay I, it is ſufficient wee ſhew you exemples in Scripture of ſuch as prayed to Angels. For of praying to Saints the old Teſtament could not write, no Saints being as then in heaven. The four Ghoſpels writt no farther then the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt to heaven, before which no Saint allſo was in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherefore you need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in the 4. Ghoſpels you ſee no mention of praying to Saints in heaven. In S. Pauls Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59494:134"/> you find him begging prayers of Saints on earth. So Hebr. 13. v. 18. <hi>Pray for us.</hi> Seeing then that prayer to Saints in heaven is more beneficiall to us, it is allſo, (by manifeſt conſequence) more to be uſed by us. And as often as the Scripture exhorts us to promote our ſaluation, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good by all meanes wee can, ſo often doth it exhort us to uſe this meanes as much (or more) then begging the prayers of others upon earth. In fine when a thing hath many ſpirituall goods in it, wee are ſufficiently invited thereunto without a command: So no body commanded Timothie, <hi>ſtill to drink water, S.</hi> Iohn <hi>to drink no wine,</hi> and to <hi>come neither eating nor drinking,</hi> nor his <hi>Diſciples to faſt often.</hi> (See Point 22.) It is ſufficient that wee obtain much good thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by praying to Saints wee obtain much good, I prove, by proving that Saints can, and will help us, which all they ſuppoſed, who called upon them, as Gen. 48.15. <hi>And Iacob bleſſed the ſons of Ioſeph, and ſayd, God before whom my Fathers walked, the Angels that delivered (or redeemed) me from all evill, bleſſe the lads.</hi> Hee calls firſt upon God, and then upon his good Angel, to helpe thoſe Children. And he tells you, <hi>that this Angel delivered him from ſeverall evils</hi> How Iacob prayed this Angel, is expreſſed Oſee
12.4. <hi>Iacob prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the Angel, and hee weept, ande made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto him.</hi> So Iobs friend (following the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59494:134"/> practiſe of thoſe times) did bidd him call upon ſome Saint or Angel, as I ſhewed laſt point, n. 3. How well the Angels wiſh us, theyr joy for the converſion of ſinners teſtifyeth. And if the evill Angels are ſo reſtles <hi>in circling about to ſee whom they can devour, and accuſe our Bretheren night and day,</hi> as I ſhewed in the former point, n. 7. The good Angels are no leſſe carefull to ſeek whome they can defend, help, and ſave.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence that earneſt prayer of that Angel Zach. 1. v.
12. <hi>And the Angel of our Lord ſayd, ô Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and on the Citties of Iuda, againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe three ſcore and tenne yeares.</hi> What call you praying, if this be not? Now hear with what effect this Angel prayed for them. <hi>And our Lord anſwered the Angel good words, confortable words.</hi> Behold here this Angel would and could help our neceſſityes. And of S. Michael in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Daniel ſayth c. 10. v. 21. <hi>There is none that holdeth with me in theſe things, but Michael your Prince.</hi> And c.
12. v. 1. <hi>At that time shall ſtand up Michael the great Prince, who ſtandeth for the Children of thy people.</hi> In what doth S. Michael ſtand for Gods people, if he doth not ſo much as pray for them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. That by the merits of Saints wee may begg and obtain favours, I prove allſo thus 1. Kings 15.5. When wicked Abias reigned in Iuda,
<hi>for <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59494:135"/> Davids ſake our Lord his God gave him a lamp in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he might rayſe up his ſonne after him and eſtablish Ieruſalem, becauſe David had done right in the eyes of our Lord.</hi> When a hundred eighty five thouſand Aſſyrians came to beſiege Ieruſalem, God by his Prophet ſayd to Ezechias. <hi>I will protect this Citty, that I may ſave it for my owne ſake, and for Davids ſake my ſervant.</hi> Iſa. 37. v. 25. That is (ſay the Proteſtants) for my promiſe made to David. But wee, ſay if they ſeeke over all Scripture, they will find no ſuch promiſe made to David of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending or protecting Ieruſalem. Yea wee prove there could be no ſuch promiſe, becauſe Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, in the captivity, was not protected but rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The power which the prayers of Saints have, and that they uſe carefully to pray for us, is often expreſſed in Scripture. Ieremy 15.1. <hi>Though Moyſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be toward the people.</hi> By which manner of ſpeeeh it appeares that <hi>Moyſes and Samuel</hi> (long ſincc dead) were (after theyr death) uſed to pray for the people, and that theyr prayers were moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So a King may ſay, though my Mother ſhall come to me, and pray, I will not hear her. You ſhall ſee Daniel of like merit and power with God in juſt ſuch another Text. (Ezech. 14. v. 14.) <hi>I will kill out of the Land man and beaſt. And if theſe three men shall be in the midſt thereof Noë, Daniel, and <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59494:135"/> Iob, they, by theyr Iuſtice, shall deliver theyr own ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Yet, though theſe three men were in it, ſayth our Lord, they shall deliver neither Sons nor Daughters, but themſelves alone shall be delivered.</hi> Which he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes again v. 20. This joyning of Daniel, (a <hi>Saint then living</hi>) with Noë and Iob, (dead ſo many hundred yeares before,) ſheweth that theſe men, by theyr prayers, no leſſe powerfully interpoſed themſelves then <hi>Daniel</hi> living. Of Elias his care to aſſiſt his people after his death, wee gave you a memorable teſtimony in the former point, n. 5. In the famous viſion of Iudas Machabeus 2. Mach. c. 15. v. 12. Firſt <hi>Onias</hi> (who had been the high Prieſt, but was now dead) <hi>ſtretching forth his hands, prayed for all the people of the Iewes. After this there appeared allſo another man, marvelous for age and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the port of great dignity about him And O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias ſayd, this is the lover of his Brethren. This is he who prayeth much for the people and the whole Cittie, Ieremy the Prophet of God.</hi> And he gave to Iudas a ſword of gold ſaying. <hi>Take the Holy ſword a gift from God, wherewith thou shall overthrow the adverſaries of my people.</hi> The event confirmed the truth of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Origen (Tom. 18. in Ioan) reflecting on this place ſayth <hi>It appeareth that Saints departed from this life, have care of the people, as it is written</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in the acts of the Machabees, many yeares after the death of Ieremy. This is Ieremy the Prophet, who prayeth much for the people.</hi> So that though the Books of <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59494:136"/> Macabees be admitted not as Scripture, but only as a true Eccleſiaſticall Hyſtory, wee have from thence that the moſt Holy High Prieſt, and cheif of Gods only people, believed that Saints prayed for us, and helped us, and that all the people (who were ſayd <hi>incouraged by this viſion</hi>) were of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me belief. How farre then is this from all novelty, which can be proved to have been practiced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dayes of the Apoſtles, and this by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority farre greater, then that of Ioſephus, or any ſuch Hiſtorian, to whom you would ſcorne to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a place in your Bible, as you do to the Hiſtory of the Machabees.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us now come to the New Teſtament. What motive ſoever moved <hi>Dives,</hi> (Luke 16.27.) to pray to Abraham ſaying, <hi>I would beſeech the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59494:136"/> ſo powerfully, (as is here expreſſed by a rodd or ſcepter of Iron) they exerciſe this theyr power chiefly by making interceſſion ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to God for us, as to obtain for us ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as wee ſtand moſt in need of, this theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer beeing given to a ſpirituall end.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And as God, (who is goodnes and mercy it ſelf in an infinite degree) doth notwithſtanding not ſo ſhew this his mercy and bounty towards thoſe, who never pray to him, as he doth to thoſe who are inceſſantly begging his help. So Saints cheifly are moved to aid thoſe who are ſtill beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theyr aſſiſtance, yet true it is that they are, of theyr own accord helping us. So Raphael offered the prayers made to God by Toby, as wee have ſeen in the former Point n. 3. So Apocal. 5.8. <hi>The four beaſts, and four and twenty elders fell before the Lambe, having every one harps and golden Vials, full of odours, which are the prayers of Saints,</hi> which prayers (made by Saints on earth) theſe Saints in heaven did know and hear, for they preſented them <hi>in gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vials.</hi> And c. 8. v. 3.
<hi>An other Angel came and ſtood at the Altar having a golden Cenſer And there was given to him much incenſe, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Altar of gold, which is before the throne of God, and the ſmook of the incenſe, which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Note that the Angel, being before the throne of God, <pb n="260" facs="tcp:59494:137"/> did there hear the prayers of Saints in earth. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> he did not only hear theyr prayers, but all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Offer them up before the throne of God in a golden Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſer,</hi> which he could not do, if he had not known the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<hi>Thirdly</hi> theſe prayers of the Saints on earth, by being thus joyntly offered up by the more fervent prayers of the Saints in heaven, or H. Angels, did become more acceptable to God. <hi>For he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the ſmook of the ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe with theſe prayers aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,</hi> (more ſweetly and pleaſantly to God)
<hi>from the hand of the Angel.</hi> God indeed knows our prayers, before the Saints or Angels offer them, but he knows that they mount up leſſe powerfully, when they be not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with theyr interceſſion. So God knew before hand that all the people anſwered Moyſes ſaying to him.
<hi>All things that our Lord hath ſpoaken, wee will do.</hi> Exod. 19. v. 8. And yet the very next words are; <hi>and Moyſes returned the words of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to our Lord.</hi> Which words were well known to God before that Moyſes did returne them, yet by returning them, he did make, by his joynt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this cheerfull offer of the people more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And becauſe he did this to theyr greater advantage Moyſes himſelfe ſayth, Deutr. 5.5. <hi>I ſtood between the Lord and you at that time.</hi> This I note to anſwer the objection of our adverſaries ſaying, it is injurious to Chriſt to take any other <pb n="261" facs="tcp:59494:137"/> Mediatour: <hi>For one is our Mediatour.</hi> To be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour is nothing but to <hi>ſtand between</hi> God and us mediating for us. In this proper ſenſe Moyſes was a Mediatour between God and his people. The ſame, in the ſame ſenſe, may be ſayd of other Saints. Yet in that ſenſe, that Chriſt is ſayd to be our only Mediatour, wee make no other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. For he is <hi>called Mediatour,</hi> becauſe he is ſo by his own worth, and by his merits offered for us, fully ſatisfying Gods anger, and capable of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. <hi>I did know that thou doſt allwayes hear me;</hi> ſayd Chriſt to his eternall father, Io. 11.42 <hi>Hee is heard for the Reverence due to him,</hi> as S. Paul ſpeaks. In this ſenſe wee make no Saint Mediatour for us. Wee only begg of them to pray for us, as wee begg of living Saints, whom; by theyr prayers, wee deſire to mediate for us. S. Paul in this ſenſe deſired the Theſſalonians to mediate for him to God.
<hi>Brethren pray for us.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5.25. And to Hebrewes 13.18.
<hi>Pray for us.</hi> And God himſelfe bidds Iobs friends uſe the mediation or interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Iob, promiſing to hear the prayers of this theyr Midiatour made for them, but no where promiſing to hear theyr prayers made without his Mediation. Yea rather intimating that he would not hear theyr prayers, unles Iob mediated for them, as now I ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If you ſay it derogates from Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59494:138"/> that any other ſhould help to ſave us, I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that Saints (yet living upon earth) help to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us. And ſo.

God tells Iobs three friends. <hi>My wrath is kindled againſt thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto you ſeaven oxen and ſeaven rammes, and go to my fervant Iob, and offer up for your ſelves a burnt offering. And my ſervant Iob shall pray for you. Him I will accept,</hi> that is, his mediation ſhall avail to your pardon. Neither do wee diſhonour, but wee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour our Saviour, when wee deſire Saints to pray for us. For by this wee ſhew the dignity of his merits to be ſo great, that, by his merits, Saints are advanced to ſo great favour with God, that theyr prayers hence come to be ſo effectuall, as were thoſe of à Moyſes, who living yet on earth, could obtain ſo often pardon for the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraël From whence allſo it proceeds, that thc Saints in heaven, as well as the Saints here li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, are in Scripture ſayd <hi>to ſave others</hi> Hence S Paul 1.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Neither laſtly do wee act againſt that precept of Chriſt ſaying, <hi>Come ye all to me</hi> A S. Paul did not act againſt the ſayd precept, when (after our Saviour had ſayd theſe words) he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went begging the prayers of the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians and Hebrews, in his Epiſtles to them. For <pb n="263" facs="tcp:59494:138"/> there be two wayes of going to Chriſt: <hi>The firſt</hi> immediatly by our ſelves, approaching reverently in prayer to him. <hi>The ſecond,</hi> and more powerfull way is (when wee, humbly acknowledging our unworthynes, and the meaneſſe of our poor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) do procure the interceſſion of Chriſts greateſt friends, to accompany with theyr joynt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our humble petitions And thus, though the Centurion did not perſonally come to Chriſt, yet he is ſayd by Saint Matthew truly to have come to Chriſt. <hi>There came to him a Centurion.</hi> Mat. 8.5. And yet S. Luke ſayd he did not come to him; for (Luke 7.3. only
<hi>he ſent unto him the elders of the Iewes, to interceed, beſeeching him that he would come.</hi> And again, <hi>when he was now not farre from the houſe, the Centurion ſent friends to him, ſaying; I am not whorthy that thou shouldeſt enter under my roof. And Chriſt marveling ſayd, neither in Iſraël have I found ſuch faith.</hi> Behold this more humble way of coming to Chriſt by Mediatours and Interceſſors ſupplying our unworthynes, farre preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former way, and that even for <hi>the faith of the perſon ſo approaching. I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> Ponder well this paſſage.</p>

                  <hi>THE XXXIX. POINT.</hi> That among the Saints it is moſt laudable to pray to our Lady. And of the Beads ſayd to her honour.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AS wee are farre from honouring our Lady more then her ſon, becauſe wee know that all the grace ſhee hath, and all her power in the Court of heaven, is wholy and entirely by her ſon; ſo are wee allſo farre from equalizing any Saint in grace or power, to the moſt Bleſſed Mother of God, who, even before ſhe was his Mother, was by the Archangel pronunced <hi>full of grace.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke 1.28 The higeſt Saints in heaven are only ſtiled <hi>ſervants of God.</hi> But our Lady is truly ſtiled
<hi>Gods Mother. Whence is this to mee that the Mother of my Lord should come to me?</hi> Luke 1.43. In all well ordered families the power of the Lords Mother incomparably exceeds the power of all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. God, who hath commanded us in a ſpeciall commandment to honour our Parents, cannot (without impiety) be thought not to yeald a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall honour to his Mother. <hi>All generations shall call her bleſſed. Becauſe he that is mighty, hath done great things to her.</hi> Luke 1.48.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Two things cheifly concurre to eminent
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59494:139"/> Sanctity: Exteriour advantages to improve our ſelves in grace, and interiour aſſiſtance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, to make beſt uſe of thoſe advantages. Our Lady in the exteriour occaſions of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her ſelfe in grace, had the greateſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that ever any creature had, even after ſhee was declared <hi>full of grace.</hi> Shee had our Saviour lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in her wombe nine Months. And ſhe knew who he was, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what graces he could beſtow upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, if ſhee neglected not to begg them. Shee did ſee the humility of his Birth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beheld all that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happened
<hi>But Mary keept all theſe things, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in her hart.</hi> Luke 2.19. All that wee read of our Lord untill he was thirtie yeare old is, that <hi>he lived ſubject to his parents. And his Mother keept all theſe ſayings in her hart.</hi> Luke 2.51. Shee then had for 30 yeares together the benefit of his example to informe her, the benefit of his converſation to move her, the benefit of his inſtruction to teach her all ſhee could deſire to learne, or he deſire to impart to her. When her Sonne began to preach to the world and the people all ſayd. <hi>Never man did ſpeak as he did,</hi> who can doubt but a Mother (ſo deerly affecting ſuch a Sonne) did hear him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re frequently, and devoutly, then any other, <hi>ſtill keeping and pondering</hi> all in her hart. But her ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>harveſt</hi> was in the time of his Paſſion, which her compaſſion made allſo to be hers. Mothers will underſtand ſome what of the Martyrdome
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59494:140"/> ſhee then ſuffered. But no body can underſtand how much after his death and aſcenſion her ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le dayly was improved by continuall Meditation of what ſhee had ſeen, and allſo by the devout feeding upon the Body of our Lord, which ſhee made her dayly bread. Now as for the interiour aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, exciting her to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the beſt advantages of all theſe occaſions, wee know that all ſuch excitations and graces are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by the hands of her own Sonne. Is not ſhee then the likeſt, to have the largeſt ſhare in all theſe graces? which graces, her Son allſo, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her to uſe ſo well to her beſt advantage, and to theyr howerly increaſe and improvement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it is, that as ſhee ſurpaſſed all in the practiſe of vertue, ſo ſhee is rayſed above all in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminency of heavenly glory. Whence it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that both love to God, and love to her neighbour being moſt perfect in her, ſhe, by them both, is moſt powerfully, moved to afford to all ſuch, as devoutly call upon her, all the aſſiſtance ſhe is able. Wherefore ſeeing her power is farre ſurpaſſing that of other Saints, wee have all reaſon to believe her interceſſion to be moſt available for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Among other devotions which wee uſe to procure this her ſo advantagious interceſſion, one is to ſay the Roſary, or Beades to her honour. Not that our Church commands any one to ſay theſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59494:140"/> beades, but that ſhe holds this to be a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing, which ſhe knoweth full well to be but a late practiſe of piety, as allſo many other prayers are moſt pious, which were made long ſince the Apoſtles time For you cannot prove that in theyr time any one prayer, which is in your <hi>Common Prayer Booke</hi> was uſed, except the
<hi>Pater noſter</hi> and <hi>Creed.</hi> Will you ſay then that the uſe of them is not laudable? Let us th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n go on.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As the Pſalter conſiſts of a hundred and fifty Pſalmes, ſo in imitation of that, the whole Roſary conſiſts of a hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries.</hi> And as the Inſtrument to which David did ſing his Pſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes, was an inſtrument of ten ſtrings, Pſ. 32.2. So wee diſtinguiſh theſe hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> into ſeverall <hi>tenns,</hi> that is, into <hi>fifteen tenns,</hi> if wee ſay the whole Roſary, or into <hi>five tenns,</hi> if wee ſay but the third part of it, as wee do, when our leaſure or devotion reacheth not at on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to the whole Roſary. Every
<hi>tenn</hi> is diſtinguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed with a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> ſayd in the beginning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. For before wee call upon our Lady, wee think it fitt to call upon our Lord, from whom all the graces of our Lady did proceed; and from whom all muſt be given, which wee begg of her to obtain For wee do not acknowledg our Lady to be the giver of any graces, though her interceſſion be moſt powerfull to obtain them to be given by her Son, When wee uſe this devotion, wee do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59494:141"/> deed ſay ten <hi>Ave Maries</hi> for one <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> But the reaſon of this is not, that wee honour our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more then our Lord; for wee are ſo farre from equalizing her to him, that wee confeſſe her infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely inferiour to him. But the reaſon is, that it is fitt wee ſhould ſet ſome time a part to honour her, or elſe wee ſhould honour her at no time. Now, as when wee are buſied in honouring our Mother, wee are not, at that time buſied in honouring our Father: So when wee beſtow this parcel of time in honouring our Lady; wee only, at this time honour our Lord, ſo farre, as all the honour we do to his Mother, is done out of the reſpect wee beare to her, becauſe ſhee is his Mother. Wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve other devotions to our Lord, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an honour of an incomparably higher ſtrain, then any honour wee give to our Lady. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord dyed on the Friday, wee, to his honour, faſt all fridayes; becauſe he remayned dead all Saturday, wee honour him for it, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from fleſh all Saturdayes. Becauſe he did riſe again on the Sunday, wee honour his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by ſolemnizing all Sundayes. Becauſe he faſted forty dayes for us, wee, to his honour, yearly faſt the forty dayes of Lent. No ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is done by us to our Lady. Our adverſaries will aske us <hi>firſt,</hi> what authority wee have for the <hi>Ave Mary. Secondly</hi> why wee uſe this prayer juſt ſo often reiterated, and how wee buſy our minds in the mean time? You will ſoon know what to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <pb n="269" facs="tcp:59494:141"/> by the enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wee ſay then the firſt part of the <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was made by an Angel; and he, as Ambaſſador from God, uſed ſuch words as he knew to be to Gods mind, ſaying to our Lady: <hi>Hail full of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce our Lord is with the, bleſſed art thou among weomen.</hi> Luke
1.28. The ſecond Part came allſo from God. For v. 41. <hi>Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and shee ſpake out with a loud voice, and ſayd; bleſſed art thou among weomen. And bleſſed is the fruit of thy wombe:</hi> The Holy Church addeth, <hi>Holy Mary Mother of God</hi> (for ſhee is in the next verſe called Mother of our Lord) <hi>pray for us ſinners, now, and at the houre of our death. Amen.</hi> Which words are moſt full of piety, ſuppoſing (what wee have proved) prayer to Saints to be pious: for if wee may pray to our Lords ſervants, wee may pray to his Mother. Behold the whole <hi>Ave Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly</hi> wee uſe juſt <hi>the number of a hundred and fifty Ave Maries,</hi> in the whole Roſary, becauſe wee would ſay a whole Pſalter to her honour. If theſe had been a hundred and fifty ſeverall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, (as there be a 150. Pſalmes) who would have remembred them? But now, they being all but the ſame prayer ſo often repeated, (and this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er allſo ſo well knowen) any ſimple perſon (though he cannot read) can ſay this whole Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our Lady without book. And it was made chiefly for a devout entertaynement for thoſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people who cannot read, though it be allſo <pb n="270" facs="tcp:59494:142"/> an excellent entertaynment even for the moſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned, when either they have not light to read, or when being wearied out with contemplation, or leſſe diſpoſed thereunto, they deſire to walke, or paſſe the time devoutly without any overmuch tiring exerciſe. If any one adds an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> more or leſſe, then this number, he doth no other hurt then he, who intending to ſay the whole Pſalter, ſhould ſay one Pſalme leſſe, or repeat one twice. Theſe hundred and fifty <hi>Ave Maries</hi> are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently divided into
<hi>fifteen tenns,</hi> to help us at every ſeverall tenne, to call to our memory, and devout conſideration, a ſeverall Myſtery of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of Chriſt and our Lady. For the prime Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of theyr lives be reduced very fitly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, into <hi>fiften Myſteries,</hi> of which <hi>five be joyfull, five be ſorrowfull,</hi> and <hi>five be glorious.</hi> To the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all theſe fifteen Myſteries, wee ſay the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen tenns, when wee ſay the whole Roſary If wee have not will or leaſure, to ſay the whole Roſary at once, then wee ſay only the beads of <hi>five tenns,</hi> honoring, or pondering, either the five joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; or the five ſorrowfull, or the five glorious Myſteries. When I ſay the firſt five tenns, at each tenn I will honour, and attentively ponder with devotion one of the <hi>five joyfull Myſteries.</hi> As <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation of our Lady,</hi> when the Angel announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto her, that God would become man, and ſhee ſhould be exalted to be his Mother. <hi>Secondly</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:59494:142"/> her <hi>Viſitation,</hi> when viſiting her Coſen
<hi>Elizabeth. As ſoon as Elizabeth heard the ſalutation of Mary, the infant did leap in her wombe, and Elizabeth was reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the Holy Ghoſt, and cryed out, Bleſſed art thou &amp;c.</hi> Luke 1.41.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Nativity of our Lord. A joy that shall be to all people, becauſe this day was borne to them a Saviour.</hi> Luke 2.10. Her joy was greateſt who was the Mother in this joyfull birth. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> her
<hi>Purification,</hi> when Simeon (in whom the Holy Ghoſt was) <hi>came in ſpirit into the Temple, and took the Child into his armes,</hi> ſhewing him to all publickly in the Temple, and declaring him to be <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of the people of Iſraël.</hi> Luke 2.32.
<hi>Fiftly her finding the loſt Child diſputing with the Doctours in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where they, <hi>all were aſtonished that heard him, upon his wiſdome and anſwers.</hi> Luke 2.47. <hi>And he went down with his Mother and lived ſubject unto her, even till</hi> he was thirty yeare old, and
<hi>shee keept all his words in her hart.</hi> v. 51.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When I come to ſay the ſecond five tenns, I will honour and ponder the <hi>five ſorrowfull My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Firſt, Chriſt his prayer in the Garden Secondly, his whipping at the Pillar. Thirdly, his Crowning with thornes. Fourthly his carrying of the Croſſe. Fifthly, his being Crucifyed, and dying upon the Croſſe.</hi> All which as Chriſt felt them moſt ſenſibly in his body, ſo our Lady, next to Chriſt, had a moſt tender fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them in her own ſoule. <hi>And her own ſoule the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59494:143"/> ſword of grief did peerce.</hi> As Holy Simeon prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed of her. Luk. 2.35. When I come to ſay the third <hi>five tenns,</hi> I will ſpend the time in ſaying each of them by meditating upon (and ſo honouring) each of <hi>the five glorious Myſteries. Firſt the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Saviour. Secondly his Aſcenſion to heavenly glory. Thirdly, his ſending the Holy Ghoſt. Fourthly, the Aſſumption of our Lady:</hi> When (as many Holy Fathers have taught) that body of hers (in which Chriſt took fleſh) was ſoon after its buriall, not made meat of wormes, but, with farre greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, made partaker of her Sons Reſurrection, then were <hi>thoſe many Saints,</hi> of whom S. Matth. c. 27.53. ſayth,
<hi>theyr graves were opened, and they roſe. And they going forth out of theyr graves after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, came into the Holy Citty, and appeared to many. Fiftly</hi> and laſtly I will, to her honour, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>her Coronation,</hi> importing her ſpecial ſtate in that heavenly glory, in which ſhee is looked upon, and reverenced by all Saints and Angels, as theyr Queen, ſhe being the Mother of the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>The Mother of my Lord.</hi> Luke 1.43.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The intent of the Holy Church, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending this devotion, is to teach all that uſe it (eſpecially the more ignorant who cannot uſe Books) how to imploy theyr minds fruitfully in a moſt commendable Meditation, of Myſteries moſt glorious to Chriſt, and his Mother, and moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to our ſoules, whilſt theyr lipps are moſt <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59494:143"/> devoutly buſied in reciting words ſo pleaſing to the Mother of God; to which end the Teachers of our Church, both by words, and by writing, ſtill are inculcating this true uſe of the Beades.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now this number of fifteen tenns, or of five tenns (ſerving ſo fitly for the orderly practiſe of ſo eaſy a devotion) cannot be more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, then by letting one Bead fall at each
<hi>Ave Mary:</hi> And the beginning of the next tenne can no way be more eaſily notifyed, then to begin the ſayd tenne with a bead of ſo different a bignes, that it may eaſily be noted, even in the dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtraction. And the ſame different Bead ſerves allſo to mind us of paſſing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a different Myſtery, unles perhaps our ſoule hath other predominant pious thoughts or affections, which (tending to a very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Meditation) are better continued then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Now, though many ſimple people uſe not theſe conſiderations, but attend only to the words they ſay, yet thoſe words be ſo excellent, that this entertaynment proves moſt vertuous, by theyr uſing the recitall of them to honour Chriſt and his Bleſſed Mother.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neither is the often repeating of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me prayers or prayer, a thing blame worthy. For if, after the ſaying of one <hi>Ave Mary,</hi> wee ſhould uſe a leſſe excellent prayer, (yea, or no prayer at all) you could not blame us. How then grow wee to <pb n="274" facs="tcp:59494:144"/> be blame worthy for uſing this ſo excellent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Hee, who ſhould every houre ſay our Lords prayer, although he ſhould do it three times each houre, is not to be blamed, but commended. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he to be blamed, who ſayth the Lords prayer three our fourſcore times in one houre? Next unto our Lords prayer, no prayer hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority or excellency, then the
<hi>Ave Mary.</hi> Why then be wee blamed for uſing it ſo often, in ſo ſhort a ſpace, whilſt (as you thinck) you remain without blame, who uſe it ſo ſeldome? our Saviour had the rareſt invention that ever man had, and (if we may make bould to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more excellent then an other) his prayer in the garden may ſeem to have been moſt excellent. And yet even then, (as rare an invention as he had) <hi>He prayed the third time uſing the ſame words,</hi> Matth. 26.44. And not inventing any new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. So likewiſe thoſe four bleſſed ſix winged Creatures, Apoc. 4.8.
<hi>Had not reſt day and night ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Omnipotent.</hi> The oftner they ſaid this one prayer over, and over, the more fervour appeares, even in ſo rare inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpirits. All the Publicans prayer was; <hi>God be mercifull to mee a ſinner.</hi> Luke 18.13. and v. 38. All the prayer of the blind man was, to cry again and again ſaying; <hi>Ieſus Sonne of David have mercy upon mee.</hi> And when they rebuked him to hold his peace, he cryed much more, <hi>Sonne of David have
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59494:144"/> mercy upon me.</hi> And thus he, by perſeverance in the ſame prayer, obtained his requeſt. Who doth not ſee a ſpeciall power to ſtirre up a great feeling of Gods mercies in the Pſalm one hundred and thirty ſix, which containeth but twenty ſeaven verſes, and yet it doth twenty ſeaven times repeat thoſe words. <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

                  <hi>THE XL. POINT.</hi> It is laudable to worship the Images of Saints.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is laudable (I ſay) to worſhip the Saintes Images in that ſenſe, in which we Roman Catholiks worſhip Images. The very Saintes themſelves we worſhip not with divine honour (as I ſayd and largely declared Point 36. n. 3. 4. 5.) And therefore it is a moſt unconſcionable ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which our Adverſaries lay upon us, ſaying that we give divine honour to Images. No: we give no ſuch honour to the Saints themſelves, much leſſe do we give it to theyr Images: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you think we worſhip the Images more then the perſon repreſented by the Images. All that we Roman Catholiks hold, as a Point of faith, may be read by all men in the Councel of Trent ſeſſ. 25. where this Councel teacheth, <hi>due honour and <pb n="276" facs="tcp:59494:145"/> veneration to be given to the Images of Chriſt and his Saints, not that there is believed to be in them any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, or Vertue, for which they are to be worshiped, or that any thing is to be asked of them, or that any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to be placed in the Images, as anciently was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the Gentils, who did put theyr hope in theyr Idols.</hi> Pſal. 115.8. <hi>But becauſe the honour, which is given to the Images, is referred to the perſons repreſented by the Images, ſo that, by, or, through the Images, which we kiſſe, and before which we uncover our head, or ly proſtrate, we adore Chriſt, and reverence the Saints, whom theſe Images repreſent.</hi> Behold the belief of our Church, teaching that all the
<hi>reverence done before Images</hi> (I pray note well this manner of ſpeach) All the honour I ſay that is ſhewed <hi>before the picture,</hi> reſteth not in the Image, but paſſeth through it, and reſteth in the perſon repreſented to me by this picture. He that abuſes <hi>King Charles</hi> his picture, or ſtatue, neither intendeth to ſhew, nor ſheweth any anger or diſreſpect to Paper, or to ſtock or ſtone. All the abuſe (by all mens Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is given to <hi>King Charles</hi> repreſented by his picture in paper, or engraven in wood, or ſtone. A further, and an evident proof of all this, is that your ſelves on the one ſide believe the Sacrament to be only a ſigne, or figure of Chriſts body, and yet on the other ſide, you count it no Idolatrie to kneel before this Sacrament at the receiving of it, becauſe that worſhip is done to the perſon ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59494:145"/> by this ſigne. But that which preſſeth you farr more is that S. Paul ſayth. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthyly is guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> 1. Cor.
11.27. Now, of this beeing guilty of Chriſts Body and blood, it is impoſſible for you to give any other reaſon, but that the abuſing of
<hi>the ſigne, or figure</hi> of Chriſts body, is a high abuſe done to the body it ſelf. The ſame is proved out of Samuel 2. c. 6.16. where (of Davids dauncing before the Arke) it is ſayd <hi>Michol ſaw David daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before our Lord.</hi> You ſee the honour thus done as much to the Ark, as our bowing, or kneeling, or proſtrating, is done to the Images, is referred not to the Ark, but to our Lord, and is layd to be done before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Firſt</hi> then I ſay wee neither are, nor can be accounted guilty of Idolatry upon this account. No underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny but this hath been the practice of the only true viſible Church for a thouſand yeares at leſt; therefore no Idolatry can be in this practice. For Idolatry deſtroyeth the very eſſence of a true Church. Moreover the Scripture manifeſtly tells us that all Idols, after the coming of our Saviour ſhall be quyte aboliſhed in his known, and viſible Church. For how can otherwiſe be underſtood that Iſa. 2.18. <hi>Idols shall he utterly abolish.</hi> That of Ezech. 36.25. <hi>I will po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer upon you cleane water. And from all your Idols I will cleanſe you.</hi> And Chap. 37. v. 23.
<hi>Neither shall <pb n="278" facs="tcp:59494:146"/> they defile themſelves any more in theyr Idols.</hi> And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore Micheas Ch. 5. v. 13. <hi>Thy graven images all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I will cut of, and thy ſtanding Images out of the midſt of thee.</hi> Therefore in Chriſts Church there can not be found the uſe of ſuch Images as were unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that is of ſuch as ſhould be made to be adored as Gods; whence the next words are. <hi>And thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</hi> Now all thoſe words are evidently ſpoken of what ſhould happen after the coming of the Meſſias; for in the beginning of this chapter is the famous Text propheſying that Chriſt ſhould be borne <hi>in Bethlem.</hi> And then he propheſyeth the enſuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his birth. Zacharias allſo ſpeaking. c. 13. v. 1. of this time ſayth
<hi>In that day shall be a fountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne lying open to the houſe of David, and it shall be in that day ſayth the Lord of Hoſtes I will cutt out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Idols out of earth, and they shall bee reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred no more.</hi> And yet what a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of Idols would it be, to ſee all Churches in the whole viſible Church, filled full of ſtatues, Images, and pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, expoſed to all to be worſhiped, if the worſhip, uſed in theſe Churches, be Idolatrous? A moſt urging Argument and cleer demonſtration. Yea among the Iewes (as prone as they were to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) there was, by Gods appointment, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſe of Images.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus God to Moyſes: <hi>Thou shalt make a mercy ſeat of pure gold. Two Cherubins alſo thou shalt <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59494:146"/> make of beaten gold, on the two ends of the mercyſeat. Let one Cherub be on the one end, and the other on the other end. And the Cherubins shall ſtretch forth theyr wings on high, covering the mercyſeat with theyr wings.</hi> Exod. 25. v. 17. And thus Moyſes, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God made the Propitiatory, that is the Oracle or mercyſeat of the pureſt gold. <hi>Two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins allſo of beaten gold on either ſide of the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes even to the mercyſeat ward were the faces of the Cherubins.</hi> Exod. 37.9. It is no ſmale ſigne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that theſe Cherubins pictures, were made of gold, as allſo that they were placed before the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle it ſelf: <hi>The Holy of Holies.</hi> Hence S. Paul ſayth Hebr. 9.5. <hi>Over it were the Cherubins of glorie sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the mercyſeat.</hi> When this Tabernacle came to be placed in Gods Temple, <hi>The Temple it ſelf had graven Cherubs in the walles.</hi> 2. Chron. 3.7. And v. 10. <hi>And in the moſt Holy houſe he made two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins of image worke and theyr faces were towards the houſe.</hi> v. 13. So that the people adored towards them. v. 14. <hi>He made the vaile of bleue and purple-crimſon, and wrought Cherubins thereon.</hi> Note here how all the people kneeled immediatly before theſe pictures when they prayed <hi>yea graven Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins were in the walles</hi> (as I ſayd) placed before them, which way ſoever they turned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is allſo a memorable paſſage of Oſee the Prophet Chap. 34. where lamenting the great deſolation of the Temple, he particularly allſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb n="280" facs="tcp:59494:147"/> the want of that Religious uſe of Images in Gods Temple. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>many dayes shall abide, many dayes ſit, without King, without Prince, without Sacrifice, and without an Image</hi> (or ſtatue) <hi>and without Theraphim</hi> that is without <hi>Images;</hi> which word of <hi>Images</hi> ſome of your Bibles have, ſome put the word <hi>Theraphim</hi> which properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies a
<hi>Statue, Image</hi> or <hi>Similitude</hi> either of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different uſe as the ſtatue which Michol put in Davids bedde, Sam. 19.16. is called
<hi>Teraphim,</hi> or of an Idolatrous uſe as Gen. 31. v. 19. <hi>Rachel ſtole</hi> the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> (Idols) of her Father, or of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſe, as in this place of Oſee, where the want of <hi>Teraphim</hi> is bewailed with the want of <hi>Sacrifice, and Altar.</hi> And hence the Ancient Rabbies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Images of Angels are not contrary to the Decalogue. The ſame we may ſay of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints, not then uſed, becauſe, as then, the Saints were not in heaven. But theyr Images now may, ſo much the more be allowed, becauſe they can be pictured in theyr own true likenes and ſhape, which Cherubins, and Angels could not, no more then God. Where (for ſimple people) you may note that it litle imports whether the Picture be juſt like the perſon pictured. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient it ſerves perfectly to repreſent him: as theſe Cherubins, and Angels, were repreſented perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to our Imaginations by theyr Images or ſtatues which were nothing like them.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:59494:147"/>5. A further proof for Images is out of S. Paul Phil. 2.10. <hi>He hath given him a name above all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that at the name of Ieſus every knee should bowe.</hi> We have from hence that becauſe this <hi>name is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve all names</hi> therefore every knee is to bowe at it. Why ſo? becauſe it is a name repreſenting Chriſt by our eares, as his Image repreſents him to our eyes. Only the Image beeing a more lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation (eſpecially to thoſe who know not the perſon) is the farre more noble Remembrance of the two. And as to bowe at the name of
<hi>Ieſus</hi> was, and is commanded the Engliſh reformed Church by theyr Canons; ſo to bowe at the more perfecter Repreſentation of
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> can not be but as lawfull an act of Reverence to his perſon. The Iewes out of Reverence to God dared not to pronounce his moſt ſacred name of <hi>Iehova</hi> (for ſo you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to read this name) now as the honour done to the name of any perſon, ſo the honour done the Image of ſuch a perſon redownes to the honour of that perſon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But becauſe our Adverſaries much blame us for uſing this honour before inſenſible creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, lett us ſee whether ſuch honour is not uſed in Scripture before things wholy inſenſible of any honour. Yet behold, before I look into the Bible, and whilſt I only ſtay looking upon it, I ſee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants cover theyr Bibles with curious covers, and placing them in decent places, and taking it <pb n="282" facs="tcp:59494:148"/> very ill if any one ſhould trample them under foot, or ſcornfully tear them in peeces. And all this is done by reaſon of the relation which the word of God hath to God himſelf. You know (and we ſhall tell you in the next Point) what honour was given to the Ark, by reaſon of the Relation it had to God in regard that from thence he gave his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to the Prieſts. And 2. Sam.
6.16. it is ſayd: <hi>Michol ſaw David dancing before our Lord.</hi> Becauſe he danced before the Ark he is ſayd to do this <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord;</hi> ſo when he kneeled or adored before it, it may allſo be properly ſayd: <hi>David kneeled and adored before our Lord.</hi> And in this ſenſe when we kneele before any Image of our Lady or Saint, we may be ſayd to kneel before our Lady or befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſuch a Saint. This manner of ſpeaking, which you account ridiculous, and ſuperſtitious, is (as you ſee) the very phraſe of Scripture in like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Yea adoration it ſelf was uſed before the Ark. David Pſal. 99.5. <hi>Sayth worship at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole for he is Holy.</hi> Mark that the reaſon, why worſhip is to be made <hi>at his footſtoole,</hi> is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this footſtoole hath to him whoſe foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole it is <hi>for he is Holy,</hi> that is, for it is the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole of him who deſerves that worſhip ſhould be done even at his footſtoole.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our Adverſaries will make us believe that they can call to mind, Chriſt and his Paſſion, as well, and as frequently, without ſeeing a Crucifix <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59494:148"/> as by ſeeing it, which is contrary to all common experience. And the Scriptures teach our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and dulnes to be much helped towards ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up pious Acts, by the outward uſe of theſe materiall ſignes. Numb. 15.38. <hi>Speak to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraël to make to them ſelves fringes in the borders of theyr garments. And it shall be to you a frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that ye may look upon it that ye may remember all the commandments of our Lord.</hi> Theſe fringes were thoſe
<hi>Philacteria</hi> Matth. 23.5. We ſee that to help theyr dulnes in remembring Gods commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, this command is given them: ſo Deutr. 6.9.
<hi>Thou shalt write them upon the poſts of thy houſe, and on the gates.</hi> And you Proteſtants uſually (for this reaſon) write them in great letters in your Churches. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us then leave by Images of our Saviour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the memory of him. Now to theyr obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You firſt object Exod. 20.4. <hi>Thou shalt not make to thee a graven thing</hi> (you read <hi>Image) nor any ſimilitude.</hi> But I pray go on. v. 5. <hi>Thou shalt not bowe down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them.</hi> I anſwer theſe laſt words do tell you the ſenſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. That is we are not to make <hi>any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thing to adore it, or ſerve it.</hi> And this is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe inſinuated in thoſe words: <hi>Thou shalt not make to thee:</hi> that is to be adored, as God,
<hi>by thee, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thee.</hi> We neither bowe to them, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to adore them as Gods, nor do wee hold <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59494:149"/> them ſo much as capable of beeing ſerved by us. Again the Hebrew word
<hi>Peſel</hi> doth only ſignify <hi>a Graven thing</hi> though you did tranſlate this word as if it had determinately ſignifyed <hi>a Graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</hi> This you did purpoſely to make us apeare Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. Certainly, if God had declared it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make Graven Images he would never have cauſed the <hi>Images of Cherubins</hi> to be made in the Ark, before whoſe only preſence Idols could not ſtand, as we ſee (1. Sam. 5.7.) <hi>by Dagon</hi> ſo often caſt downe before it. Neither would Salomon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve preſumed to place round about the walls of Gods Temple Images of Cherubins. Wherefore in this command Idols only are forbidden and not ſuch Images as are not uſed as Idols. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the ſeptuagint (whom you pretend to follow) hath the very word <hi>eidolon</hi> that is Idols, why then tranſlate you
<hi>Graven Images?</hi> If our Images be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols God hath not fullfilled his promiſe to take out of his Church the worſhip of Idols as I ſayd n.

               <p n="9">9. Your other and only objection to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is Exod. 32. To anſwer which I muſt note ſome things before I put it.
<hi>Firſt</hi> the people beeing aſſembled againſt Aaron ſayd.
<hi>Ariſe make us Gods that they may go before us.</hi> v. 1.
<hi>Secondly</hi> Aaron kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that they ment ſuch Gods, as they had ſeen worſhiped in Aegypt, made them a <hi>Molten calfe</hi> neither can you think of any other reaſon why he <pb n="285" facs="tcp:59494:149"/> made rather <hi>a Calfe,</hi> then any other thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Aegyptians worſhiped theyr God <hi>Apis or Serapis,</hi> in the ſhape of a <hi>black Calfe with white ſpotts</hi> as S. Auguſtin teſtifyeth l. 18. de Civit. c. 5. <hi>Thirdly</hi> this Calfe beeing molten v. 4. they ſayd: <hi>Theſe be thy Gods ô Iſrael which have brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt: which when Aaron had ſeen, he built an Altar before it, and by the Cryers voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce proclamed ſaying. To morow is the Feaſt of our Lord.</hi> Here comes your objection. The word which Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron uſeth here, for <hi>the Lord</hi> is the name <hi>Adonai or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova</hi> as your Proteſtants will have it: a name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the God of Iſraël: ſo that it ſeems they only worſhipped the God of Iſraël. Neither is it (ſay our adverſaries) credible, that Aaron would do otherwiſe, or that he could call the Aegyptian God, by the moſt ſacred name of all names, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſo eſpecially appropriated to the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raël. Whence (ſay they) you committ Idolatry, if through the Images you worſhip the perſon it repreſents. For the Iſraëlits, when they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Idolatry, did only, through that Calfe, worſhip the God of Iſraël, repreſented by It. And this ſeems ſtrongly confirmed. For Ieroboam rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the ſelfſame Idolatry by making molten Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to the houſe of Iſraël yet, through theſe Calves he only worſhiped the God of Iſraël, calling him <hi>Baali</hi> as appeares by theſe words of Hoſea c. 2. v. 16. <hi>And it shall be in that day, ſayth our Lord, that <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59494:150"/> thou shalt call mee no more Baali.</hi> Where you ſee the God of Iſraël ſayth they called him <hi>Baali. Him</hi> therefore the Iſraëlits worſhiped <hi>Calling him Baali,</hi> And ſo through <hi>Baali</hi> they worſhiped <hi>him.</hi> I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were that they did not, in this theyr Idolatry, worſhip the true God but falſe Gods. The people themſelves deſired <hi>Gods to be made them</hi> by Aaron, as is thrice, in that Chapter of Exodus, expreſſed. And Aaron knowing that they meant ſuch Gods, as they had ſeen worſhipped by the Aegyptians, did (for that reaſon) make a Calfe as I ſayd. To this Calfe (or if you will to the Aegyptian God A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis through this Calfe) they did offer Sacrifice. Hence God ſayd to Moyſes v. 8. <hi>They have made them a molten Calfe and have worshiped it, and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereunto. And ſayd theſe are the Gods of Iſraël who have brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt.</hi> You ſee God himſelf ſayth they have <hi>worshipped it,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed thereunto:</hi> that is to the very Calfe, and not to the true God. And they did not acknowledge that the true God had delivered them from Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, but they did attribute theyr delivery <hi>to the Gods,</hi> to witt the Aegyptian Gods. Wherefore the true God ſayd (in that place of Exodus juſt now cited) <hi>They have quickly revolted forgetting me</hi> who ſo very lately did ſo many wonders to deliver them, all which they, now aſcribe to the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Gods. And that you may ſee I ſay this moſt groundedly, I ſhew the ſame expreſly ſayd in <pb n="287" facs="tcp:59494:150"/> other Scriptures, Moyſes, ſpeaking of this very act of Idolatry here committed, ſayth Deutr. 32.16. <hi>They provoked him with ſtrange Gods.</hi> The God of Iſraël can not be called a <hi>ſtrange God.</hi> And the next words are: <hi>They Sacrificed to Divels not to God.</hi> And yet you ſay they Sacrificed to the true God, which allſo is expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the next words. <hi>They Sacrificed to new Gods, that came newly up, to Gods whom they knew not. To Gods whom theyr Fathers fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not.</hi> What more clear? David allſo manifeſtly Pſal. 106. v. 19. <hi>They have made a Calfe in Horeb, and they worshipped the molten Image, they forgott theyr Saviour who had done great things in Aegypt.</hi> A ſtrange thing indeed it was that all thoſe ſtrange wonders ſhould be ſo ſoon forgot. But it is that very thing for which God ſo often blameth them. So that Moyſes, with great reaſon, wondred how Aaron could be brought to be partaker in this ſin, and as aſtoniſhed he asked him (Exod. 32.20.) <hi>what hath this people done to thee</hi> (for I am ſure they muſt have uſed great violence, and force to bring thee to this) <hi>that thou shouldeſt bring upon them an heinous ſin?</hi> Aaron, for his excuſe, allegeth the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to him. Now whereas Aaron pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed this ſolemnity as <hi>the ſolemnity of the Lord of Iſraël,</hi> he did ſo becauſe, he denounced that the very ſelf ſame honour ſhould to morrow be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nly given to this Idol which was formerly given to the God of Iſraël. And ſeeing that they reſolved <pb n="288" facs="tcp:59494:151"/> to giue to this new God all other honours, they would allſo give him the honour of the higheſt name
<hi>Iehova;</hi> a name yet famous among them. So you might lately ſee a Quaker ſay to Iames Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. <hi>Thou art my Chriſt,</hi> as S. Paul ſayd of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils Rom 1.21 <hi>that whereas they knew God, yet they did not glorify him as God. And they changed the glorie of the incorruptible God into a ſimilitude of a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fourfooted beaſt.</hi> So might we ſay of theſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes Now I anſwer what was added of Ieroboams renewing this Idolatry. For he allſo did worſhip falſe and ſtrange Gods, as appeares by what God ſpoak by his Prophet Ahias 1. Kings 14.3. <hi>Thou haſt gone and made thee other Gods, and caſt me behind thy back:</hi> So that he did not honour (for of him theſe words are ſayd) the God of Iſraël in thoſe Idols, but caſting him of, he honored <hi>other Gods</hi> yea in Chap. 12.32. <hi>He Sacrificed unto the Calves that he had made.</hi> But how then (ſay you) did they call the God of Iſraël <hi>Baali?</hi> I anſwer, that as a Quaker calling <hi>Iames Nayler</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, doth make Chriſt to be no better man then <hi>Iames Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and ſo doth as good as call Chriſt <hi>Iames Nayler.</hi> Even ſo theſe Iewes taking
<hi>Baali</hi> for theyr true God, did ſay, that in effect, theyr true God was no better then <hi>Baali,</hi> and ſo they vilifyed him as much as if
<hi>they had called him Baali,</hi> giving all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Baali</hi> that was due to God; yea even the honour of beeing theyr chief God as wee ſayd of Aaron.</p>

Thus I have anſwered at large this theyr beſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t upon which chiefly they muſt build theyr uncharitable, and heinous accuſation of the whole viſible Church to have been guilty of the higheſt of Crimes, that is of Idolatry it ſelf. Alas! how farr ſhort doth this objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come of making good ſo foul an accuſation, which is moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly made if it cannot be better proved then by this weak argument.</p>

                  <hi>THE XLI. POINT.</hi> It is Laudable to worship the Reliques of Saints.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL the worſhipe, we give to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Saints, is only ſuch reſpect as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Creatures are capable of, as to be kiſſed, coſtly inſhrined, touched, worn, and uſed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence &amp;c. And all this is meerly for the reſpect we beare unto the perſon, whoſe Reliques they be. By the worſhip done to the Ark, we ſhall fitly both prove, and declare the honour, of which ſuch inſenſible holy things are capable. The Ark of God was only that portable litle chappel, in which God was pleaſed to ſpeak, and impart his mind to the High Prieſt, conſulting him with due Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And yet, ſee I pray, what honour God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59494:152"/> would have done to this Ark, though it were a creature inſenſible of Honour, and only capable of beeing honored for his ſake to whom it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And this relative honour was exceeding great, and extended to manyfold ſtrange expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Reverence. Yet all theſe honours were farr from beeing Idolatrous: yea God by this ſo much worſhiped Ark confounded Idolatry. For 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Dagon fell upon his face unto the earth before it.</hi> Let us ſee what reverence God declared due to the Ark. When (without reſpect) <hi>they had looked on the Ark of our Lord he ſmote of the people fifty thouſand.</hi> Chap. 6.19 And 2. Sam. 6.6.
<hi>Becauſe Vzzah put forth his hand to the Ark of God, and took hold of it. For the oxen shook it. God ſmote him for his errour, and he dyed by the Ark.</hi> Whence David fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring want of due piety in himſelf ſayd, <hi>how shall the Ark of our Lord come to me? And ſo he cauſed it to tourne into the houſe of Obededon, where it was three months. And our Lord bleſſed him and all his houſe.</hi> We may then hope for bleſſings by wearing Reliques, by having Saints Bodyes buried in our cities &amp;c. And when Salomon placed the Ark in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 2. Chron. 5. v. 2. <hi>He gathered to geather all the ancients of Iſraël and all the Princes of the heads of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Children of Iſraël into Ieruſalem, to bring the Ark from the citty of David, which is Sion.</hi> See here this moſt ſtately and goodly proceſſion to bring the Ark. <hi>And all that were gathered before the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59494:152"/> Ark Sacrificed Sheep and Oxen, which could not be tould nor numbred for multitude.</hi> v. 6. And God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this Proceſſion and Tranſlation of the Ark by a miraculous Cloude filling the houſe of our Lord
<hi>ſo that the Prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter by reaſon of the cloude v.</hi> 14. Laugh not then at our Proceſſions made in Tranſlations of Reliques this beeing done for the Ark. Now of other Reliques. 2. Kings 2 v.
13. <hi>Elizeus took the mantle of Elias, he ſmote the waters the ſecond time and they were divided this way and that way, and Elizeus paſſed over.</hi> Do you not ſee how Elizeus, yea rather how God hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a ſtupendious miracle, <hi>the cloake of Elias?</hi> No wonder then Saints bodyes ſhould be more graced with miracles then theyr garments. Read what followeth there c. 13 v. 20. <hi>Elizeus therefore dyed, and they buried him. And the Bands of the Moabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes invaded the Land the ſame yeare. And it came to paſſe as they were burying a man, behold they ſpyed a Band of men, and they caſt the man into the ſepulcher of Elizeus</hi> (anciently they buried in the open fields making caves, and grottes capable of more bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes (<hi>And when the man was lett downe, and touched the bones of Elizeus, he revived, and ſtood upon his feet.</hi> And will you be ſtill ſcoffing at us <hi>for devout tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Saints bones</hi> when ſo caſuall a touch, cauſed ſo great, and ſtupendius a good to that man as was the reſtoring of his life? Note allſo how God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored Elizeus his bones by ſo miraculous an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:59494:153"/>2. Now to joyne the new Teſtament with the old. I find that for keaping with all Reverence, and rich inſhrining of Reliques we read thus Heb. 9.4. <hi>In the which (Ark) was a golden pott having Manna, and the rodd of Aaron that had budded, and the Tables of the Covenant.</hi> All theſe Reliques (ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably placed in gold and in the Ark) were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence all hid by Ieremie with it, and in it. And ſo after the Captivity thus beeing miraculouſly found, were, with all pompe, placed in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was reſtored by Zorobabel, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by Herod, And there they remayned till Hieruſalem (under <hi>Titus and Veſpaſian</hi>) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and had not left a ſtone upon a ſtone. This is moſt to be noted; becauſe Proteſtants ſcoff ſo much at us for believing the wood of the H. Croſſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d many ſuch Reliques to be preſerved ſo many yeares uncorrupt. Indeed (though this be no part of our faith) the probability of it is hence invincibly confirmed. For the Tabernacle and all things perteyning to it was finiſhed about the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the world 2485. Now Chriſt was borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the yeare of the world. 4000. He lived 33. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and 40. yeares after his death Ieruſalem was overthrown; ſo that the Ark and Tabernacle with theyr Veiles and Courtaines, and other apperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, laſted wel neer 2000. yeares uncorrupt, and ſo the Rodd of Aaron ſo much inferior to the Croſſe, and the table of the Law, yea and the <pb n="293" facs="tcp:59494:153"/> Manna it ſelf though ſo corruptible by nature that, what was gathered one day, would grow full of wormes the next day unleſſe it were the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. No wonder then many Reliques ſhould keep, and be reverently keept ſince Chriſts time which, is farr ſhorter then the ſpace which theſe Reliques were keept as appeares by S. Paul. Lett us go on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What Relique meaner then the latchet of a ſhoe? and yet S. Iohn Baptiſt (the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which had riſen) ſayd truly Io. 1. v. 27. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe shoes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi> For the Relation it had to Chriſt. With what reverence think you, would a S. Iohn Baptiſt have touched that poor leather thong? Hence that devout woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Matth. 9.21. <hi>If I may but touch his garment I shall be whole. And Ieſus turning him, and ſeeing her ſayth. Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> The faith the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, in this devout touch, was not ſuperſtitious. Note here how the cure, was wrought by this exterior touch, with interior faith, ſee Mark 5.30. Luke 8.46. who Chap. 6.19. ſayth. <hi>The whole multitude ſought to touch him. For vertue came out of him and cured all.</hi> We indeed touch the Reliques with faith and Reverence, but the vertue, by which any favour is granted, comes from the Saint whoſe Reliques wee touch, God giving him power to aſſiſt us for our devout recourſe to him. Hence Apoc. 2.26. <hi>He that shall overcome, <pb n="294" facs="tcp:59494:154"/> and keep my words to the end, I will give him power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nations.</hi> He ſhall have power to helpe even whole nations, but he ſhall have this power given by me. <hi>I will give him &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Note allſo that the very manner of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other things to touch Saints Bodyes, and, after they have touched them, to apply them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion (a thing moſt ieered at by our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) is notwithſtanding a thing recommended unto us in Scripture, propoſing the example of the firſt and beſt Chriſtians in this point Act. 19.12.
<hi>There were allſo brought from his (Pauls) body nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, or handkerch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fs upon the ſick, and the deſeaſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, and the wicked ſpirits went out.</hi> Do not then blame us for hoping to obtaine ſome bleſſings by wearing Saints bloud or bones, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reliques which commonly have a farr grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Relation to them then thoſe napkins or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchifs had to S. Paul, meerly in reſpect of a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple touch of his body, unles you dare venture to ſay that it is more to touch a Saints Body, when his ſoule liveth in it, then when his ſoul lives with God in heaven. I pray tell me what hath a thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner relation to man, then his ſhadow? Or what apprentiſe Painter of one days ſtanding, will not be able to make a better Image of ſuch a man then his ſhadow is? And yet the firſt and pureſt Chriſtians, did hold the very ſhadow of Saints in great veneration, either becauſe it was a kind of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59494:154"/> Picture of them, or had ſome ſmale relation at leſt to them. And God confirmed theyr devotion by a world of miracles Act.
5.5. <hi>In ſo much that they did bring forth theyr ſick into the ſtreits, and layd them in beddes, and couches that at leſt the shadow of Peter paſsing by, might over shadow ſome of them.</hi> Our Bibles have
<hi>that they all might be delivered from theyr infirmities.</hi> Which it ſeems they ſhould not have been though they had been neerer to him on the other ſide, on which the Sunne ſhined. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te here that there beeing ſo great a reſort of all, and all beeing cured, ſurely many came devoutly from remoter parts to enjoy this favour. Blame not then our Pilgrimages to his Body it ſelf at Rome where he is enterred, beeing the Scripture ſheweth many to have come, to his very ſhadow to obtaine help.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Point following hath ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with this preſent point, that as we deſire the Reader to note all here ſayd for proof of that point, ſo, we deſire him, for further proof of this point, to have recourſe to what ſhall be ſayd in the point following. And particularly in both thefe points we earneſtly intreate our adverſaries to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how many, and how ſtrong Texts we bring for our doctrine in theſe points, and how few, and how weak proofs they can bring out of Scripture to the contrary. It is a ſhame to them to appeale to Scripture in theſe Points or to ſay they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <pb n="296" facs="tcp:59494:155"/> our errors in them by clear Scripture, which is here ſo clear againſt them.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>THE XLII. POINT.</hi> Some places are more Holy then others, we therefore laudably make Pilgrimages and Proceſsions to ſuch Holy places.</head>
               <p n="1">1. OVt of Holy Scripture it is evident ſome places were more Holy then others, and for that reſpect choyce was made of ſuch places to performe the beſt acts of devotion. The great Patriarch Abraham had digged a well, and there called upon God by that ſolemne oath which he made to Abimalech Gen 21.31. <hi>Wherefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that place Beershebath that is the well of the oath.</hi> This is the place of which it is ſayd Gen. 26.23.
<hi>And he</hi> (Iſaac) <hi>went up from thence to Beersheba. And the Lord appeared to him that night, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, I will bleſſe thee and multiply thy ſeed for my (dead) ſervants Abraham ſake.</hi> He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Well was accounted a ſanctified place. And you ſhall find in the 46. Chap v. 1. that Iacob (or Iſraël) many yeares after taking his journey <hi>with all things that he had</hi> (towards Aegypt)
<hi>came to the well of the oath and offering there Sacrifice to the God of his father Iſaac</hi> (who there, as I ſayd, appeared to Iſaac) <hi>he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59494:155"/> heard God by a viſion in the night calling him &amp;c.</hi> You ſee Iacob with all his Children beginning his journey with a Pilgrimage to this Holy Place, you ſee that purpoſely he makes choyce of this place to offer there Sacrifice. You ſee God in this Holy place favoring him with a heavenly viſion as he had done his Holy Father Iſaac in the ſame place. Doth not then God make choyſe of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place rather then of others?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The place where God appeared, is to be called and hield Holy. So Exod. 3.5. God out of the burning buſh to Moyſes ſayth, <hi>draw not nigh hither, looſe of thy shoe from thy feet. For the place wherein thou ſtands is Holy ground,</hi> to witt, made <hi>Holy</hi> and ſanctified by the preſence of God, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an Angel ſent as Gods Embaſſadour. For Acts. 7.30. S. Stephen ſayth: <hi>There appeared to Moyſes an Angel in the fire of the flame of a bush ſaying looſe of thy shoe, for the place wherein thou ſtandeſt is Holy ground.</hi> Whence it was the tranſitory preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of an Angel appearing for that ſo ſhort a time, which did Sanctify this place, and make reſpect and reverence due to it <hi>upon that account.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by good conſequence the permanent abode of a Saints body, reſting in ſuch a monument, may do the like: that is, may Sanctify this place. This is allſo made evident by the mouth of that Angel who exacted reverence to be done in the place where he appeared (Ioſ. 5.) <hi>ſaying to Ioſue I am the <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59494:156"/> Captain of the Hoſts of our Lord, looſe thy shoe from thy feet For the place wherein thou doſt ſtand is Holy.</hi> The ordinary common field of Iericho was, by the Angels preſence, made ſo Holy that it was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to tread upon it with a ſhoe. Wherefore tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who come bare foot to the Bodyes of Saints commit no ſuperſtitious exceſſe in devotion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover ſome places are farr more Holy then others. There was a place in which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory or Mercyſeat ſtood, called
<hi>Sancta San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, the Holy of Holyes</hi> or the Holieſt of all, to which place, for reverence to it, none approached <hi>but the High Prieſt alone once a yeare, not without blood.</hi> Hebr. 9.7. Thus offering Sacrifice allwayes when he entred this <hi>ſo Holy a place</hi> which is the higheſt act of worſhip. And, becauſe Sacrifice was the higheſt act of worſhip, God would not permitt that to be performed in any ordinary Holy place. But he thus commanded the people of Iſraël Deutr. 12.5. <hi>To the place which the Lord your God shall chooſe out of your Tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall you ſeek, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall yeu come, Thither shall you bring your burnt offerings and Sacrifices,</hi> where I note that this place is called <hi>his habitation</hi> or dwelling place In which ſenſe ſome Catholiks may ſay, <hi>our Lady dwells at Sichem</hi> or
<hi>Loretto,</hi> for the choiſe God hath made of thoſe places in order to beſtow favours and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſuch as there implored our Ladys aid. Note
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59494:156"/> allſo that verſe 26. How farr of ſoever they lived, God commands <hi>the things Sacrificed and vowed to our Lord to be all offered here.</hi> So that Pilgrimage to this Holy place, did allwayes accompany this Holy offering. His command doth juſtify the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea becauſe the Temple of Salomon (which was the place choſen) was the place thus Sanctifyed, and made ſo peculiarly
<hi>Holy,</hi> the very ordinary prayers which men made, when they came in Pilgrimage to this place, and made them there, were upon that account, more pleaſing to God, and ſooner heard by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. For 2. Chron. 6.19. <hi>His eyes be open upon this houſe night and day, upon the place whereof thou haſt ſayd that thou wouldeſt put thy name there to harken to the prayer which thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant prayeth TOWARDS THIS PLACE: harken to the ſupplication of the people made TOWARDS THIS PLACE.</hi> And the next verſes are all full of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings begged for them who ſhall pray, or make ſupplication, or ſpread forth his hands <hi>in THIS HOVSE.</hi> v. 24.29. Wherefore, for eaſier obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all theſe bleſſings, a Pilgrimage to this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce was uſually undertaken. For a Pilgrimage is nothing elſe, but only a going to ſome Holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for devotion. Thoſe who could not go to the Temple, or Ieruſalem would at leaſt turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards theſe places when they prayed, as we ſhall preſently ſee Daniel did.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:59494:157"/>5. At the firſt bringing of the Ark into the Temple there was a moſt ſolemne Proceſſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de 2. Chron.
5. by the <hi>King Salomon himſelf gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the ancients of Iſraël, and all the Princes of the Tribes, and the heads of the families of the Children of Iſraël to bring the Ark of the Covenant from the citty of David.</hi> From that place then the Proceſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the Prieſts, and Levits carrying the veſſels of the Sanctuary, and at the Temple in mount Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria the Proceſſion ended, with Sacrifices without number.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pilgrimages to this place, and proceſſions, at the ſame time were uſed by the moſt Holy Kings of the Iewes. So 2. Chron.
20.3. <hi>The moſt pious king Ioſaphat feared, and ſet himſelf to ſeek our Lord, and proclaimed a faſt through all Iuda. And Iuda gathered themſelves to gather to ask help of our Lord. Then v.</hi> 13. <hi>All Iuda ſtood before the Lord with there litle ones, theyr wives, and theyr Children.</hi> For with them they all came up in Pilgrimage to this place, here making this ſo ſolemne ſupplication. And God, upon the very place, prophecyed victory to them. And Ioſaphat the next day cauſed a proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſingers to the Lord to go before his Armey ſinging that Pſalm <hi>Prayſe the Lord. And when they began to ſing prayſes, our Lord tourned the Ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon themſelves.</hi> Lo here the pious proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion favored from heaven with a ſtupendious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. For they, not fighting one ſtroke, theyr eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59494:157"/> by theyr own ſwords lay dead, in ſo great a number that <hi>for three dayes they could not take away the ſpoiles for the greatnes of the prey.</hi> v. 25. And v.
28. The fourth day <hi>they entred into Ieruſalem with Pſalteries, and Harpes, and Trumpets into the houſe of our Lord.</hi> Thus by a Pilgrimage and Proceſſion, returning thanks for ſo great a victory got purely by a Pilgrimage, and Proceſſion accompanied with faſting and prayer as we uſually accompanie our Pilgrimages and Proceſſions. How often do Proteſtants read theſe places, and for want of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in theſe devotions, never underſtand them or note them?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Againe what ſhall, or can they ſay, to that pious fact of <hi>Naaman</hi> generall Captaine of Syria cleanſed from his Leproſie by waſhing <hi>ſeaven times in the river Iordan.</hi> God preſcribed the waters of the Holy Land for his cure though he had better in his Country as he ſayd 2. Kings 5.12. But it is for a farr other reaſon why I ſpeak of <hi>Naaman.</hi> It is becauſe beeing hartely converted by this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and reſolved to ſerve only the God of Iſraël, he ſayd to Elizeus v. 17. <hi>Shall not then, I pray thee, to thy ſervant be given two mules burthen of earth. For thy ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hence forth will offer neither Burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nor Sacrifice but unto the Lord.</hi> Where I obſerve that he apprehending how hard it was for one of his quality to come in Pilgrimage to Ieruſalem and Sacrifice there, and knowing himſelf (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59494:158"/> he was a ſtranger) to be licenſed to Sacrifice elſe where, would notwithſtanding carry the earth of that Holy Land (a Land choſen by God for his ſervice) that upon the <hi>Holy earth</hi> he might raiſe an Altar, and ſo do his devotions in <hi>a Holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> as well as circumſtances permitted. Yet how do our Adverſaries ſcoſſ at us, if we bring a little earth from about our Lords ſepulcher, or Mount Calvary upon which he ſhedde his blood, more ſanctifying that earth then ever earth was Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed? When Daniel was captive, and could not go to the temple to pray yet <hi>His windowes beeing open in his chamber towards Ieruſalem, he kneeled upon his knees thrice a day, and prayed, and gave thankes to his God as he did afore time.</hi> Dan 6.10. Behould this was his uſual devotion to turne towards a Holy place and pray when in body he cold not go thither.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the new Teſtament you have Matth. 2. the three ſages or Kings coming an exceeding long Pilgrimage to adore, in perſonall preſence, our new borne Saviour, allthough they knew fullwell that he did, as well ſee, and heare, all the reſpect, and devout prayers performed to him by them in theyr own Countries, as farr of as they were Yet they
<hi>perſonally</hi> would ſhew theyr reſpect by waiting on him in perſon. So we Catholikes perſonally will honour S Peter in preſence of his body at Rome, by going to that end ſo long a <pb n="303" facs="tcp:59494:158"/> Pilgrimage, allthough we full well know he could hear our prayers made at our own houſes, yet we know thoſe prayers to be more acceptable to him (as hath formerly been ſhewed concerning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made in Holy places) expecially when thoſe prayers receive ſo great force from ſo painfull, and devout a Pilgrimage. Again in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament you have allſo Io. 12. v. 20.
<hi>That there were certaine Greeks who came up to worship at the feaſts.</hi> Theſe Greeks were not obliged to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Law. But theyr devotion exhorted them to this long Pilgrimage. And though they were by birth deſcending from the Gentils, yet theyr co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to worſhip makes it evident that they were true believers. Now that this theyr Pilgrimage was gratfull to our Saviour it appeares by his divine providenc ordering things ſo that they ſhould be introduced in, to ſee him at ſuch a time as a voyce came from heaven (ſaying) <hi>I have glorifyed it</hi> (thy name) <hi>and again I will glorify it.</hi> v. 28. Likewiſe, <hi>Philip</hi> by Gods ſpeciall providence was ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, convert and baptiſe that noble Eunuch of Candace Queen of Aethiopia <hi>who was come to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to adore though he lived as farre of as Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia. A grattfull Pilgrimage to God though not commanded him by God. See Acts 8. v. 26. evident therefore it is that ſome places are to be held more Holy then others and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we do laudably go in Pilgrimages to them <pb n="304" facs="tcp:59494:159"/> that is we go to them for devotion ſake, to do our beſt duty to God in thoſe places. Again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour was tranſfigured on <hi>Mount Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</hi> S. Peter calls that Mount a <hi>Holy Mount.</hi> 2. Pet. 1.18. <hi>When we were with him in the Holy Mount.</hi> So ſay I, becauſe our Saviour was ſo diſfigured at <hi>Mount Calvary</hi> and all beſprinkled that place with his ſacred bloud, that is allſo a <hi>Holy Mount.</hi> And farre more grattfull to God be all the devotions which are made in that Holy place.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is a memorable paſſage of Iohn e. 5.2. to confirme all that hath been ſayd or that is believed, or practized among us in this Point. <hi>For there is in Ieruſalem by the sheepmarket a Poole having five Porches, in theſe lay a great multitude of perſons, blind, lame, withered, expecting the ſtirring of the water. And an Angel of our Lord deſcended at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time into the Pond, and the water was ſtirred, and he that had gone down firſt into the Pond after the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the water, was made whole of what infirmity ſoever.</hi> Interpreters affirme this great and conſtant miracle (which was true though the former Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures never did ſett it downe) to have therefore been given to the water of this Pond, (which made ſo great recourſe of Pilgrims to that Place) becauſe the Carcaſſes of the ſheep Sacrificed in the Temple, were waſhed in this Pond, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood of them did runne into it. Shall not the bloud of Martyrs, Sacrificed for Chriſt, <pb n="305" facs="tcp:59494:159"/> more Sanctify any place, where it was ſhedde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud of ſheep Sacrificed in his honour? Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce any Relique hath leſſe relation to the perſon whoſe Relique it is then this miraculous Pond had to that great Lord to whoſe honour theſe beaſtes were ſacrificed. Yet this Pond had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God deputed to look after it. The miracle was conſtant and infallible. And ſo no wonder a great multitude of perſons came from remote pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in pilgrimage to this place; ſo allſo many came or were brought even to S. Peters ſhadow, as we noted in the former Point n. 5. His bones and other Reliques have a farre ſtricter relation to him then his ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Lett no man think that miracles now ceaſe. All England knowes that our Kings, by touching with certaine Ceremonies, cured, and ſtill cure <hi>the Kings Evell,</hi> and all France knows theyr Kings do ſo, to this day. The firſt for S. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſake, the other for S. Lewis. Our Saviour ſpeaks home when he ſayth (and he ſayth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limiting any time) <hi>He that believeth in me, the workes that I do, he allſo shall do, and greater then theſe shall he do.</hi> Io. 14.12.

                  <hi>THE XLIII. POINT.</hi> That wee laudably keep feaſts in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Saints.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THeſe feaſtes to many ſeeme to have no ground in Scripture, and therefore not to be keept, but to be eſteemed unwarrantable. Yet wee ſay firſt, the Apoſtles may have inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeverall feaſts of our Lord, and our Lady, though they thought that they ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to poſterity upon the warant of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only. For they knew, that upon tradition only, <hi>the Sabboth</hi> had been kept from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world untill Moyſes, that is for 2400. yeares. After which time Moyſes did firſt ſett downe in writing this command. Yet at the very beginning of the world Gen. 2.3. <hi>God bleſſed the ſeaventh day, and ſanctifyed it.</hi> See the 2. Point n. 2. And thus we know, by Tradition only, that wee are not any longer to keep the ſeaventh day, though God <hi>had ſanctifyed</hi> it, but that wee are to keep the Sunday in honour of his Reſurrection, which is the <hi>eighth</hi> and not
<hi>the ſeaventh day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, it is a ſtrange thing that wee ſhould
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59494:160"/> be appointed by the Apoſtles to keep weekely a feaſt in honour of that day of the weeke, on which Chriſt did riſe, and yet ſhould not be appointed to keep the feaſt of the Reſurrection it ſelf. The Iewes keept theyr Pentecoſt for having receaved Gods law in written tables. And ſhall not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians keep a Pentecoſt for having receaved the law of grace firſt divulged, and written in mens harts, at the coming of the Holy Ghoſt. If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt be a myſtery ſo great that one day every weeke ſhould be keept through the whole yeare Holyday in honour of it, ſhall Chriſts Aſcenſion be ſo farre inferiour, that no one day in a yeare (and conſequently no one in an age) is to be keept in memory of it? Had the Iewes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles, becauſe God preſerved them living in Tabernacles 40. yeares in the wilderneſſ (a benefitt belonging only to theyr Fathers) And hath not the Church reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a feaſt in the honour of Chriſt coming to live in the Tabernacle of our fleſh at his Nativity? And another feaſt in memory of his giving us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhape of Bread, his body to remaine in all the Tabernacles of our Churches, and to enter ſo often into the Tabernacles of our Breaſts; both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefitts to us perſonally, and allſo to all our poſterity? Had the Iewes all reaſon to keep a feaſt of aſſembly, or Collection, in gratitude for the peaceable poſſeſſion of the Land of promiſſe, <pb n="308" facs="tcp:59494:161"/> and have not wee more reaſon to keep the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all Saints (our moſt Holy Fathers) who now are in peaceable poſſeſſion of the <hi>Land of the living,</hi> and the <hi>inheritance of Chriſt,</hi> and from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce afford us help and aſſiſtance to come thither? Had the Iewes ſufficient reaſon to keep <hi>the feaſts of Trumpets</hi> (Numb. 29. v. 6.) in gratefull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that theyr father <hi>Iſaac</hi> was freed from beeing ſacrificed by Abraham, God ſending a Ramme to be ſacrificed in his place (and therefore they all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayſe offered a Ramme in that feaſt) and hath not the Church ſufficient reaſon to keep a leſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſt in gratefull memory that our <hi>chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and head of our Church S. Peter</hi> was freed, when Herod intended bloudily to Sacrifice him to the good pleaſure of the Iewes, and when <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was made to God without intermiſsion by the Church for him.</hi> Act. 12.5. <hi>An Angel of our Lord was ſent the night before Herod would have brought him forth to deliver him,</hi> as well as to deliver Iſaac, now upon the point of beeing ſlain. This I bring becauſe many wonder that wee keep a feaſt (though leſſe ſolemne) of S. Peters Chaines, and of his delivery from them. As for the feaſts of Martyrs, becauſe to them it is a greater benefitt to ſuffer all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conſummate them by death it ſelf, then to be freed by miracle from them, the Church hath all reaſon to ſolemnize the dayes upon which God glorifyed theſe bleſſed Martyrs by enabling
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59494:161"/> them, firſt to undergo ſo exceſſive torments ſo couragiouſly, and then crowned them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall bliſſe after theyr Victory. The Iewes allſo beſides theſe ſolemnities here mentioned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theyr weekly ſabboth had divers other feaſts; yea every <hi>new Moon</hi> brought them at leaſt one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. And will you think that Gods Church can have no reaſon, nor authority to appoint any other feaſt then the Sunday?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will therefore farther ſhew you out of Scripture that, beſides the feaſts appointed by God in Scripture, other feaſts have been ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded laudably by the authority of the Church. By which will appeare her authority to do this when ſhe judgeth it expedient. The law preſcribed the ſolemnity of Azymes, or of unleavened bread, to be keept but ſeaven dayes. Yet upon a peculiar occaſion it ſeemed expedient to the Church (then aſſembled) to add ſeaven more, ſo ſayth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
2. Chron. 30.23. <hi>The whole Aſſembly took counſell to keep other ſeaven dayes, and they keept other ſeaven dayes.</hi> And the Scripture adds (v. 27) in commendation of this great piety. <hi>And the Prieſts, and Levites bleſsing the people, theyr voyce was heard, and theyr prayer came up to his Holy Habitation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> For as in Holy places, ſo in Holy times prayers are more effectuall, as here they were in a Time made Holy, or ſet a part to Gods ſervice by the authority of the Church only.</p>

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59494:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. Again Eſther 9.20. upon the like authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it pleaſed the Iewes, <hi>to eſtablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the Month Adar, and fifteenth day of the ſame, yearly. As the dayes wherein the Iewes reſted from theyr enimies, and the month which was turned to them from ſorrow to ioy. And the Iewes undertook to do this.</hi> And v. 27. <hi>The Iewes ordeyned, and took upon them, and upon theyr ſeed, and upon all ſuch as joyned themſelves unto them; ſo as it should not faile, that they would not keep theſe two dayes according to theyr appointed time every yeare.</hi> Why? Did any Scripture command this? No: but the Church did put this obligation upon it ſelf. <hi>The Iewes</hi> (ſayth the Scripture) <hi>took upon themſelves and theyr ſeed.</hi> Chriſts Church hath no leſſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this kind, then the Iewiſh Church had, to impoſe an obligation upon
<hi>herſelf and her ſeed, and upon all that will be ioyned to her Religion.</hi> Wee read allſo that, becauſe the Church ſo judged it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, a perpetuall feaſt with an Octave (that is, laſting for eight dayes) was inſtituted Mach. 4.56. with out any peculiar warrant from Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common warrant of holding that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable which the Church appointed. Now if the bookes of Machabees be not true Scripture (as we hold them to be) yet at leaſt, according to our Adverſaries, they conteyne a faithfull Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtory, in which (in the place cited) it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. <hi>That they keept the Dedication of theyr Altar
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59494:162"/> eight dayes.</hi> Moreover v. 59. <hi>Iudas</hi> (then high Prieſt) <hi>and his brethren, with the whole congregation of Iſraël ordeyned that the dayes of the Dedication of the Altar should be keept in theyr ſeaſon, from year to year, by the ſpace of eight dayes from the five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith of the Month Caſleu</hi> (that is November) This Feaſt was keept by the Iewiſh Church untill our Saviours time, and that with out warrant of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Yea our Saviour himſelf obſerved it. For ſo wee read Io. 10.22. <hi>And the feaſt of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in Ieruſalem, and it was winter.</hi> I know the feaſt of the Dedication of the Temple reſtored. 1. Eſd. 6. Was in February, and therefore in winter. But this beeing the winter before his death, it could not be in that part of the winter which was ſpent as farre as February; becauſe our Saviour is there by S. Iohn, and by the other Evangeliſts ſayd to have done more then could be done between Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary and 25. of March upon which he ſuffered death. So that Beza himſelf in his <hi>Annotations</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this place of S. Iohn confeſſeth this feaſt (wich our Saviour keept) to have been the feaſt wee ſpeak of. A great proof allſo of uſing prayer for the dead. For had the Inſtitutor of this feaſt (who in that book is recorded to have uſed prayer for the dead) had he (I ſay) been ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly given, Chriſt would never have keept a feaſt of his Inſtitution. Note here allſo the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for feaſts of Dedications ſo uſuall in our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59494:163"/> Church, yet ſo unheard of among Proteſtants.</p>

                  <hi>THE XLIV. POINT.</hi> That wee laudably obſerve Faſts, Saints Eves, and other dayes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. OVt of the former Point wee make this ſtrong argument. The Church hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to oblige her ſubjects to keep ſuch, and ſuch Feaſts, as hath been proved, therefore ſhe hath the power to oblige her ſubjects to keep ſuch and ſuch faſting dayes, for the Scriptures ſpeak univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally of this obedience, requiring of us carefully <hi>to hear the Church</hi> Matth. 18.17. and ſaying <hi>he that heareth you heareth me. He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me.</hi> Luke 10. v. 16. As allſo
<hi>obey them that have the Rule over you for they watch for your ſoules.</hi> Hebr. 13.17. Yea though <hi>Scribes and Phariſees</hi> ſhould (by lawfull ſucceſſion) <hi>ſit upon the chayre of Moyſes.</hi> Chriſt himſelf will bid us <hi>Therefore to do all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they command All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> Matth. 23. v. 2. And if you ſay that wee muſt obey only, when they bring cleer Scripture, you are refuted by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer point, where you ſee ſo many feaſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with out cleer Scripture which did no where appoint thoſe feaſts: ſhe then may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59494:163"/> faſtes not commanded by Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And now I will ſhew you faſts to have been commanded by the Church upon a day not appointed in Scripture but only by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the High Prieſt, or Church. So <hi>Ioſaphat proclaimed a faſt to all Iuda.</hi> 2. Chron. 20.3.

And Heſt. 9.27. <hi>The Iewes ordeyned and took upon them, and upon theyr ſeed, ſo as it should not fail that they would keep theſe two dayes (of feaſt) every yeare.</hi> And v. 31. <hi>They decreed for theyr ſelves, and for theyr ſeed, the faſtings and theyr cry.</hi> For <hi>faſting</hi> and
<hi>crying</hi> to our Lord were fitly then appointed to be obſerved in the Vigil or Eave of this feaſt, as we uſually faſt in the Vigils of our feaſts; for devout faſting beſt diſpoſeth our mind to devotion the next day. Moreover you Proteſtants teach there be no Counſels given us by God, but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; If this be ſo, God himſelf commands you to faſt, when he ſayeth Ioel 2 12. <hi>Turn ye to me with <pb n="314" facs="tcp:59494:164"/> all your hearts a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with faſting, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d weeping, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mourning.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Wee faſt on Ember dayes becauſe thoſe dayes be deputed by the Church to ordaine and Conſecrate new Prieſts and other Miniſters of the Church. And it is Chriſts command Matth. 9.38. <hi>Pray the Lord of the Harveſt that he ſend forth work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into his harveſt.</hi> To obey this command the more perfectly, and to make our Prayer, powred forth for ſo important a bleſſing, the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, the Church with this prayer, ioyneth three dayes faſt. So of the moſt primitive Church wee read, Acts 13.3. <hi>When they had faſted, and prayed, and layd theyr hands on them they ſent them away</hi> (to witt Barnabas and Saul) <hi>ſe they beeing ſent by the Holy Ghoſt departed.</hi> And Chap.

Shee allſo knew, by Scripture, that it was expedient <hi>to keep under our Body, and bring it into ſubjection.</hi> 1. Cor. 9.27. <hi>And to approve our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in watchings and faſtings.</hi> 2. Cor. 6.5. <hi>And to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve our ſelves to faſting.</hi> 1. Cor. 7.5.

Now there beeing ſo great good in faſting and all Gods greateſt Saints ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving practiſed it ſo much upon this account (as I ſhewed out of Scripture Point 23.) it is a wonder that, among our ungodly Saints, even good Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day it ſelf (on which we receaved a greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt then ever man kind received) ſhould have no more notice commanded to be taken thereof then if Chriſt his death belonged not to us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wee faſt the Eves of ſeverall great feaſts, ſo to be the better diſpoſed to prayer the next day. By faſting allſo we imitate and excite thoſe Saints to help us whoſe feaſt wee ſolemnize, thus more honoring them, and more powerfully imploring theyr interceſſion by faſting ioyned with our <pb n="316" facs="tcp:59494:165"/> prayers. Wee faſt for 40. dayes in Lent for even the moſt ancient Fathers called this faſt an
<hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Tradition.</hi> And ſurely if the Apoſtles had not, together with the other practiſes of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; delivered allſo this practiſe of faſting for 40. dayes (the like may be ſayd of faſting weekely) no man afterward could have had ſufficient authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this through the whole multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to make them all believe themſelves to be obliged to faſt ſo often. Men love theyr belley to well to be brought ſo eaſily to ſuch an inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen as this ſeems to many. Nothing but a ſtrict command of an undoubted authority could have made all Chriſtianity accept of this great faſt, with that rigour, which Luther found in the whole Church at his time. Some Proteſtants venture to ſay that Pope Teleſphorus (who lived Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 141.) was the firſt that comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this faſt. They ſhould have ſayed he was the firſt that by written Law commanded the more exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Apoſtolicall Tradition which, by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me mens neglect, was grown to be leſſe obſerved; if they make him the firſt Introducer of Lent, then they muſt be enforced to confeſſe that, in that primitive age, the Popes authority was known for undoubted, and reverently obeyed even over all Chriſtendome at that time, and this in a matter which pincheth many ſo hardly that we ſee here in England neither the known Laws of the land, <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59494:165"/> made by thoſe of theyr own Religion, nor the Kings Proclamations preſſing thoſe Lawes, nor the Penalties enjoyned by them, can prevail half ſo much in this one nation, as the Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Lent did, in thoſe pure, and primitive ages, prevail through all Chriſtian nations. I muſt not end this point without obſerving that the whole Church may ſtand obliged to obſerve ſuch and ſuch faſts, notifyed to her without any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by the ſole atteſtation of Church Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, delivering this obligation as impoſed firſt by the Apoſtles, or ſuch like lawfull authority. For, from the dayes of Noë untill Moyſes (that is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a thouſand yeares, all were obliged thus <hi>not to eat the flesh with the bloud.</hi> Gen. 9.4. (ſee Point 2. n. 2.) A Command made known to them only by Tradition.</p>

               <p n="1">1. OVr adverſaries finding faſting ſo often, and ſo highly commended in Scripture, and not knowing well how to find fault with it, they turne to pick a quarell againſt our manner of faſting. For upon faſting dayes wee abſtaine from <pb n="318" facs="tcp:59494:166"/> fleſh, and in Lent from eggs, yea from whitemeates alſo in ſome places: for wee hold that the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive, or laborious the faſt is (ſo that it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet) the more perfect it is, of its own nature, as beeing more ſatisfactory for our ſins paſt; and, by more taming of our fleſh, more preventive of new ſins, and conteyning a greater exerciſe of vertue to the greater encreaſe of merit. Not that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in our ſufferings, as they are afflictive of us but becauſe he highly delights in them, as they are ſo many wayes beneficiall unto us; hence Ioel 2.12. <hi>Turne ye unto me with all your heart and with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi> Now to faſt all day, with out eating any thing, is a thing over hard to be preſcribed by preccpt, to ſuch a vaſt eommunity as the Church is.

<hi>Secondly</hi> that the meat wee then eat be not of fleſh, which, beeing more nouriſhing, doth allſo nouriſh temptations. <hi>Thirdly</hi> that at night wee eat no ſupper; but a ſlight collation is permitted for fear our nights reſt ſhould otherwiſe be loſt, with prejudice of health.

But other faſts we have yet more rigorous as from egges, and all that is made of egges; from <pb n="319" facs="tcp:59494:166"/> whitemeat, which no one (who hath the ſenſe of feeling) can deny to be a very conſiderable addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the auſterity of faſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This abſtaining from certaine nouriſhing and delightfull meates is peculiarly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Scripture as eſpecially pleaſing to God. <hi>Firſt</hi> the Nazarites Num. 6. were obliged to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from wine: though wine were the uſuall drink of theyr Country there beeing no beer. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> Ieremy 35. The Rechabites in like manner, abſtaining, upon command, from wine, are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by God, and rewarded for it v. 18. <hi>Thirdly</hi> (S. Luke c. 1.15.) <hi>He shall be great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord, wine, and ſtrong drink he shall not drink. Fourthly</hi> the ſame great Iohn Baptiſts ordinary food <hi>was Locuſts and wild hony.</hi> Matth. 3.4. And, even of this courſe food, he did feed ſo ſparingly, that Chriſt himſelf ſayd <hi>he came neither eating nor drinking.</hi> Matth. 11.18. <hi>Fiftly</hi> S. Timothey could not be induced
<hi>to drink a litle wine in the weaknes of his ſtomake and his often infirmities,</hi> untill S. Paul (for this reaſon) adviſed him not
<hi>ſtill to drink wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 1. Tim. 5.22. <hi>Sixtly</hi> I might adde that this kind of faſt is the moſt effectuall to <hi>keep under our bodyes and bring them into ſubjection leaſt we become reprobate</hi> as S. Paul ſayd of himſelf. 1. Cor. 9.27. Daniel ſayth allſo of himſelf
<hi>Flesh and wine entred not into my mouth for three weekes.</hi> Dan.

               <p n="3">3. Hence we may eaſily anſwer our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59494:167"/> objections. <hi>Firſt</hi> then they object Mark.
7.15. <hi>Nothing that is with out a man entring into a man can defile him.</hi> For the ſenſe is this, no meat, of its own nature, is polluting, or defiling; though to eat meats that are forbidden doth pollute and defile the ſoul, as the Apple defiled Adams ſoul; as allſo the taking of drink in exceſſe pollutes the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard. And even after our Saviour ſpoak theſe words, eating of Hoggs fleſh would have defiled the ſoules of the Apoſtles. Yea and the firſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians ſhould have been defiled by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>bloud or meates ſtrangled.</hi> Not becauſe thoſe meates were ſtill uncleane but becauſe the Church thought fitt, yea and
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> to forbidd, at that time, the eating of thoſe meates Acts 15.28. <hi>It hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us to lay no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burden upon you then theſe neceſſary things, that you abſtain from meat offered to Idols, and bloud and that which is ſtrangled.</hi> So Gen. 9.4. For above a thouſand years before Scripture all were obliged
<hi>not to eath the flesh with the bloud</hi> And this no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture then either commanded or teſtifyed; yet, even then, not the meat, but the breach of the Churches commandment would have defiled them, and ſtill defileth us if wee eat what the ſame Church ſtill forbids to be eaten at the times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly</hi> you object 1. Cor. 10. v. 25. <hi>All that is ſould in shambles eat, asking no queſtien for <pb n="321" facs="tcp:59494:167"/> Conſcience.</hi> I anſwer that the Apoſtle there only tells them, that, though to eat in the Temple of Idols, that which there is offered up to the Idol, be unlawfull v. 28. yet wee muſt not have a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of eating what we ſee <hi>ſould in the shambles,</hi> by asking queſtions (out of an over timerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) whether that ox or Calf, or ſheep, ſould there, were not (before it was brought to the markett) immolated to ſome Idol? Now what is this to our purpoſe?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is objected Col. 2 16. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat nor drink, or in reſpect of a Holy day, or of the new Moon, or of the Sabboth.</hi> I anſwer by what is here added <hi>of a new Moon</hi> it is manifeſt this Text only ſpeaks of faſts according to Iudaicall diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between meat clean, and unclean, all meats beeing now clean to Chriſtians ſtill, as above, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting bloud and <hi>ſtrangled meat</hi> though ſold in the ſhambles, for this is not contrary to that S. Paul ſayd: <hi>All that is ſold in the ſambles eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and chiefly they object. 1. Tim.
4.3. <hi>The doctrine of devils, forbidding to marrie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to abſtaine from meates, which God created to receive with thanks giving. For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refuſed which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with thanksgiving.</hi> For as much as concernes our doctrine of abſtaining from marriage, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve all ready anſwered this Text in Point
20. n. 8. We muſt ſee now in what ſenſe it is <hi>Devils doctrine
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59494:168"/> to abſtaine from meats, which God created.</hi> It can not be in that ſenſe, in which the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> and
<hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> abſtained from wine, and S. Iohn Baptiſt from wine and ſtrong drink and from all meats allmoſt but <hi>Locuſtes and wild hony coming neither ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nor drinking:</hi> Or in which S. Timothy allſo abſtained from wine: or in which all Chriſtians, as then, abſtained from
<hi>bloud</hi> and what was <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled or offered to Idols.</hi> The abſtinence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees was Devils doctrine: for they taught to abſtaine from meats <hi>which God created.</hi> Becauſe they ſayd that the <hi>Devil, and not God, created ſome meates.</hi> Againſt ſuch men S. Paul, of all meates without exception, ſayth, <hi>God created them.</hi> To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſuch meates to the devils creation (and therefore to abſtaine from them) is to teach the doctrine of the devils. This doctrine of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees was held by divers more ancient Heretiks as the Rhemiſh Teſtament ſheweth in this place. Again the doctrine of ſome Iewes was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, who taught that ſtill we muſt make a diſtinction between meates <hi>clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> and abſtaine from theſe becauſe the <hi>Law was given by Angels,</hi> and they ſayd that the Angels had revealed, that therefore this law was ſtill to be keept, even by Chriſtians. But theſe Angels were Angels of darknes, and this was truly
<hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils,</hi> though diſguiſed in the ſhape of Angels of light. This is the Interpretation of the <pb n="323" facs="tcp:59494:168"/> moſt learned Tertullian, as I allſo ſhewed Point 36. n. 9.</p>

               <p>SVppoſing theſe fourtie five Points have been with attention read by thee, it only remains that I ſhould preſſe thee to anſwer mee ſincerely to this one queſtion. Whether in thy Conſcience, and in the ſight of Allmighty God, thou canſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meyn perſwaded that wee Roman Catholikes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, ſo much as in any one of theſe Points, hield, or forthield, any doctrine oppoſit to clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Name that Point, and read over again what wee here have ſayd of it: and ſee if thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth not tell thee that wee have rather clearer Scripture for it, then you for the contrary. Why then are wee, who did build (in a manner) all the Churches in England, and who taught no other doctrine in them, then what had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us at our firſt beeing made Chriſtians, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine found ſo conformable to Scripture, even in theſe uery points, in which we ſtand accuſed by you to moſt contradict Scripture, why (I ſay) ſhould wee not ſo much as have one Church left us in one ſhire, or County, with free liberty to teach, and practiſe that faith, which hath been taught, and practiced by all our forefathers in this Kingdome, and eſtabliſhed by all the Lawes <pb facs="tcp:59494:169"/> thereof, ever ſince wee profeſſed Chriſtianity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this laſt Age gave birth to ſo many new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
